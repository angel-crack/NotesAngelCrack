User Templates are used to apply a group of settings and features to new users. There are two default User Templates, one for system administrators and one for standard voicemail users. These templates can be modified or new templates can be created.

User templates are often used to define the default settings for a group of users based on their location or department. They can be used to define local settings such as the default PIN or password, privileges on the server, and where the “0” out option from a mailbox goes.

User Templates are only used when a new user is created. Changing a template does not affect users that were created using that template.
