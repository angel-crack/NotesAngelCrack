Call Management in Cisco Unity Connection is combination of different call management elements that can be used to customize how your system handles the calls and collect input from callers.

Unity Connection provides the following elements for managing incoming and outgoing calls:

| Components             | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Call Handlers          | Answer calls and take messages; provide menus of options (for example, “For customer service press 1, for sales press 2...”); route calls to the users and other call handlers; and play audiotext (prerecorded information).                                                                                                        |
| Directory Handlers     | Provide access to a corporate directory by playing an audio list that users and outside callers use to reach a users and leave messages.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Interview Handlers     | Collect information from callers by playing a series of questions and then recording the answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Call Routing Tables    | Allow you to define how calls are initially routed, based on criteria such as the phone number of the caller and the schedule. When you have set up call handlers, interview handlers, directory handlers, and extensions for users, you can route the calls to the applicable person or handler by editing the call routing tables. |
| Restriction Tables     | Control outgoing calls by allowing you to specify the numbers that Unity Connection can dial for transferring calls, for notifying users of messages, and for delivering faxes.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Schedules and Holidays | Define business, nonbusiness, and holiday hours for the organization for the purpose of controlling which set of call routing rules, greetings, or transfer options is currently active.                                                                                                                                             |
All of these elements can be used as building blocks. You can use or customize the default objects in Unity Connection, or add new objects and combine them to create the caller experience.
