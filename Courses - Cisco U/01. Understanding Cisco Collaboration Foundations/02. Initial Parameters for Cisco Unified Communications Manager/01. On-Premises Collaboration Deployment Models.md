This topic will describe how Cisco Unified Communications Manager can be deployed for resilience and scale.

## Cisco Unified Communications Manager Resilience and Scale

A single Cisco Unified Communications Manager server can provide all the necessary services to run a collaboration system. Still, if something were to happen to that server, then the whole phone system would fail. The number of phones that a single server can support is also limited, although, in smaller deployments, this may not be an issue.

If you cluster a number of Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers together, you can provide a much larger and far more resilient system. Clusters of Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers can be deployed in multiple ways depending on the needs of the network.

There are four basic on-premises deployment models:

- Campus: single-site deployment
- Centralized: Multisite with centralized call processing
- Distributed: Multisite with distributed call processing
- Clustering over the WAN

## Campus: Single-site Deployment

![[Pasted image 20241103155221.png]]

In this call-processing deployment model, the Unified Communications services and the endpoints are colocated on the campus. Communications between the endpoints traverse a LAN or a metropolitan-area network (MAN), and communications outside the enterprise go over an external network such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN). An enterprise would typically deploy the campus model over a single building or over a group of buildings connected by a LAN or MAN.

## Design Guidelines

Because VoIP calls are within the LAN or campus network, it is assumed that bandwidth is not a concern. Using G.722 or G.711 coder-decoders (codecs) for all endpoints will eliminate the need for Digital Signaling Processors (DSP) resources for transcoding, and those resources can be allocated to other functions such as conferencing and Media Termination Points (MTPs).

All off-net calls will be diverted to the PSTN or sent to the legacy PBX for call routing if the PSTN resources are being shared during migratory deployments.

Deploy the recommended network infrastructure for high-availability, fault-tolerant infrastructure, connectivity options for telephones (inline power), quality of service (QoS) mechanisms, and other services.

Do not oversubscribe to Cisco Unified Communications Manager to scale larger installations. A single-site deployment does not always equate to a single cluster. If the site has more than 40,000 IP phones, install multiple clusters and configure Inter Cluster Trunks (ICTs) between the clusters.

## Benefits

Single-site deployment allows each site to be completely self-contained. Calls between sites will be routed over the PSTN. Extra provisioning of WAN bandwidth is not needed. Dial plans are also easier to provision. There are no service issues in the event of an IP WAN failure or insufficient bandwidth, and there is no loss of call-processing service or functionality.

In summary, the main benefits of the single-site model are:

- Ease of deployment
- A common infrastructure for a converged solution
- Simplified dial plan
- No transcoding resources are required due to the use of a single codec

## Centralized: Multisite Deployments with Centralized Call Processing

![[Pasted image 20241103155231.png]]

The multisite WAN with centralized call-processing model consists of a centralized Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster that provides services for many sites (max 2000) and uses the IP WAN to transport IP telephony and call-signaling traffic between the sites.

Applications such as voicemail and interactive voice response systems are typically centralized as well to reduce the overall costs of administration and maintenance.

When the IP WAN is down, the IP phones at the remote branch office can register to the Cisco Unified Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST) router. The Cisco Unified SRST router can process calls between registered IP phones and can send calls to other sites through the PSTN. Although there is no limit to the number of phones at each branch site, the model of router that Cisco Unified SRST is running on will limit the number of phones supported.

To avoid oversubscribing the WAN links with voice traffic, causing deterioration of the quality of established calls, CAC (Call Admission Control) is used to limit the number of calls between the sites. Also, a low-bandwidth codec such as G.729 should be used between sites, while G.711 or G.722 can be used inside each site.

Centralized call-processing models can take advantage of automatic alternate routing (AAR) features. AAR allows Cisco Unified Communications Manager to dynamically reroute a call over the PSTN if the call is denied because of CAC.

## Benefits

Multisite WAN with centralized call processing saves PSTN costs for intersite calls by using the IP WAN instead of the PSTN. IP WAN can also be used to bypass toll charges by routing calls through remote site gateways that are closer to the PSTN number that is dialed. This practice is known as Tail End Hop Off (TEHO).

This deployment model maximizes the utilization of available bandwidth by allowing voice traffic to share the IP WAN with other types of traffic. Deploying QoS and CAC ensures voice quality. AAR reroutes the call over the PSTN if CAC denies the calls because of oversubscription.

## Distributed: Multisite with Distributed Call Processing

![[Pasted image 20241103155239.png]]

The model for a multisite deployment with distributed call processing consists of multiple independent sites, each with its own call-processing agent cluster connected to an IP WAN that carries voice traffic between the distributed sites.

Each site in the distributed call-processing model can be one of the following:

- A single site with its own call processing agent, which can be either:
    1. Cisco Unified Communications Manager
    2. Cisco Business Edition
    3. Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express
    4. A third-party IP PBX
    5. A legacy PBX with VoIP gateway
- A centralized call-processing site and all associated remote sites


## Design Guidelines

- A centralized platform for trunk and dial plan aggregation is commonly deployed. This platform is typically a Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition cluster. However, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Proxy Server could also be used to provide the intercluster call routing and dial plan aggregation in multisite distributed call-processing deployments.
    
- Centralized services such as:
    1. Centralized PSTN access
    2. Centralized voicemail
    3. Centralized conferencin

    ## Note

    These services can be deployed centrally, thus benefiting from centralized management and economies of scale. Services that need to track end-user status (for example, Cisco IM and Presence) must connect to the Unified Communications Manager cluster for the users that they serve.

- High-bandwidth audio (for example, G.711 or G.722) between devices in the same site, but low-bandwidth audio (for example, G.729) between devices in different sites.
- High-bandwidth video (for example, 1.5 Mbps with 4CIF or 720p, to 2 Mbps with 1080p) between devices in the same site, but the low-bandwidth video (for example, 384 kbps with 448p or CIF) between devices at different sites.
- Minimum of 1.5 Mbps or greater WAN link speeds. Video is not recommended on WAN connections that operate at speeds slower than 1.5 Mbps.
- Call admission control is achieved through Enhanced Locations CAC.

An IP WAN interconnects all the distributed call-processing sites. Typically, the PSTN serves as a backup connection between the sites in case the IP WAN connection fails or does not have any more available bandwidth.

## Benefits

The multisite WAN with distributed call processing deployment model is a superset of both single-site and multisite WAN with centralized call processing.

The multisite WAN with distributed call-processing model provides these benefits:

- PSTN call cost savings are possible when using the IP WAN for calls between sites.
- In this model, you can use the IP WAN to bypass toll charges by routing calls through remote site gateways, closer to the PSTN number that is dialed—that is, TEHO.
- Maximum utilization of available bandwidth is possible by allowing voice traffic to share the IP WAN with other types of traffic.
## Clustering over the WAN

![[Pasted image 20241103155249.png]]

Cisco supports Cisco Unified Communications Manager clusters over a WAN. Some of the characteristics of this model include the following:

- Applications and Cisco Unified Communications Manager of the same cluster can be distributed over the IP WAN.
- The IP WAN carries intracluster server communication and signaling.
- Limited number of sites:
    1. Two to four sites for local failover (two Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers per site)
    2. Up to eight sites for remote failover across the IP WAN (one Cisco Unified Communications –Manager server per site)

The cluster design is useful for customers who require more functionality than the limited feature set that is offered by Cisco Unified SRST. This network design also allows remote offices to support more IP phones than Cisco Unified SRST if the connection to the primary Cisco Unified Communications Manager is lost.

## Design Guidelines

Although the distributed single-cluster call-processing model offers some significant advantages, it must adhere to these strict design guidelines:

- Two Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers in a cluster must have a maximum round-trip delay of 80 ms between them. In comparison, high-quality voice guidelines dictate that one-way, end-to-end delay should not exceed 150 ms. Because of this strict guideline, this design can be used only between closely connected, high-speed locations.
- For every 10,000 Busy Hour Call Attempts (BHCAs) within the cluster, an extra 900 kbps of WAN bandwidth for intracluster run-time communication must be supported. The BHCA represents the number of call attempts that are made during the busiest hour of the day.
- Up to eight small sites are supported using the remote failover deployment model. Remote failover allows you to deploy one server per location (a maximum of eight call-processing servers are supported in a cluster). If Cisco Unified Communications Manager fails, IP phones will register to another server over the WAN. Therefore, Cisco Unified SRST is not required in this deployment model (although it is supported). The remote failover design may require significant additional bandwidth, depending on the number of telephones at each location.

## Benefits

Clustering over the IP WAN provides a combination of the benefits of the two multisite deployment models to satisfy specific site requirements.

Although there are stringent requirements, clustering over the IP WAN offers these advantages:

- Single point of administration for users for all sites within the cluster
- Feature transparency
- Shared line appearances
- Cisco Extension Mobility within the cluster
- A unified dial plan

The clustering over IP WAN design is useful for customers who want to combine these advantages with the benefits that are provided by a local call-processing agent at each site (intrasite signaling is kept local, independent of WAN failures) and requires more functionality at the remote sites than is provided by Cisco Unified SRST. This network design also allows remote offices to support more Cisco IP phones than Cisco Unified SRST in the event of WAN failure.

These features make clustering across the IP WAN ideal as a disaster-recovery plan for business continuance sites or as a single solution for up to eight small or medium sites.
