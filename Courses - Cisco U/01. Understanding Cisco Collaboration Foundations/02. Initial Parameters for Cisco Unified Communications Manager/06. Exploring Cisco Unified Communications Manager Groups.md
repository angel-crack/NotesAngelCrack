IP phones receive their configuration from the TFTP server. This configuration includes a list of Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers that an IP phone can register. This prioritized list is known as a Unified CM Group and includes a maximum of three servers running the CallManager service. The first server in the list is the primary server, the second, and third servers in the list are the backup and tertiary servers respectively.

A Cisco Unified Communications Manager server can belong to multiple groups. In the figure, there are six servers in the cluster. Three of the servers are added to a group that will be used by IP phones in the San Jose location, while three different servers have been added to a group that will be used by IP phones in the London location. The Johannesburg location uses two servers, one from the San Jose location and one from the London location.

In this example, an IP phone in Johannesburg would register with its primary server, which is San Jose. In the event of a WAN outage, where the connection to the primary server fails, the Johannesburg IP phones would register with its backup server in London. If the outage was larger and no connection could be made to either the primary or secondary servers, the IP phones can use a local router configured as a Cisco Unified SRST router.

## Note

Cisco Unified SRST can be used in the event connections/registrations to the primary, secondary, or tertiary were to fail.

## Unified CM Group Design 1:1

When designing a Cisco Unified Communications Server environment, it is important to understand the scale and redundancy that is needed for the organization.

In the first figure, there are three servers deployed to the maximum size, which is 10,000 phones per server. If a network has more than 1250 users, it is recommended to deploy a dedicated server to act as the publisher and TFTP server. This server will not run as a call-processing node. There are two servers deployed to provide call-processing redundancy for the phones. All the phones will register to their primary server. In the event of an outage, they will register to their backup server. This design provides a one-to-one redundancy option.

In the second figure, the scale has increased. There are now five servers. One server is now the dedicated publisher and TFTP server, while the other four are running the Cisco CallManager service. These four servers provide call-processing services to the cluster. In this design, 20,000 IP phones can register to the two primary servers—10,000 on each server. If either one of these servers experiences an outage, their registered IP phones will register to their backup servers. This approach is still a one-to-one redundancy design because each call-processing server has a single backup server.

The last figure it illustrates the maximum design for a Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster. There is a total of eight servers running the Cisco CallManager service, which is the maximum limit in a cluster. Each server can support 10,000 IP phones with a corresponding backup server.

Although a one-to-one design offers the best redundancy for the network, the cost is higher as more servers are required.

## Unified CM Group Design 2:1

![[Pasted image 20241104134636.png]]

In a two-to-one redundancy design, you still offer redundancy for the IP phones in the event of a single-server failure. However, a multiserver failure might still cause a network outage.

The first figure has not changed when compared to the one-to-one design, where there is only one primary server.

The center of the figure has changed. There are now two primary servers that share a single backup server. If either of the primary servers experiences an outage, their registered IP phones will register to the backup server. If both primary servers were to fail at the same time, then half the phones would fail to register.

In the last figure, there are now four primary servers that provide total support for 40,000 phones (10,000 phones/server). Each of the two primary servers shares one backup (2:1 design). In this design, a maximum of two primary servers can fail as long as two servers do not share the same backup server.

The 2:1 design option reduces the number of servers needed when compared to the 1:1 design while still providing redundancy for the IP phones. However, this redundancy option is not as robust as the 1:1 design.

## Unified CM Group – Load Sharing

![[Pasted image 20241104134647.png]]

Instead of having all 10,000 phones registering with a single server and using the second server as a backup, the phones can be configured to share the load between the servers.

In this example, two Cisco Unified CM Groups would be created. The group on the left defines the server on the left as the primary, and the server on the right as the backup. In the group on the right, the order is reverse, so that the right server is defined as the primary and the left server is defined as the backup.

After the groups have been created, 5000 of the IP phones are associated with the left group, and the other 5000 IP phones are associated with the right group. This design allows for half the IP phones to be registered to each of the servers. In the event of either server experiencing a failure, the registered IP phones on the failed server would register to their respective backup server. During the failure, one of the servers registered all 10,000 IP phones, which would put the server at its maximum capability. However, during normal operation with no outage, each server would be providing phone registration for up to 50 percent of its maximum capability.
