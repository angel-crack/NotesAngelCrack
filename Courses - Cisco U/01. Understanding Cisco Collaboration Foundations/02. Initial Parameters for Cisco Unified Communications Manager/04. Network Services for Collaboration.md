Call control devices, including Cisco Unified Communications Manager, depend on additional network elements. In particular, the Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster uses Network Time Protocol (NTP) (Public or Private), and DNS services and endpoints use DHCP and TFTP services.

## Network Services: NTP

NTP services are a mandatory requirement for Cisco Unified Communications Manager clusters. For redundancy, you should configure at least three NTP servers, one of which should be external. The publisher synchronizes to the external primary clock source while the subscribers get their clock source from the publisher.

Accuracy is required for:

- Phone display
- Call lists
- Voicemail
- Reporting and troubleshooting
- Call Detail Records: Billing

## Network Services: DHCP

DHCP is used to provide hosts with initial configuration information, which includes the IP address, Subnet Mask, default gateway, DNS server addresses, and the all-important TFTP (Option 150) IP address which points to the TFTP service running on at least one of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

## Note

DHCP sources can be from Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express, the router, servers, and so on.

The DHCP server in Cisco Unified Communications Manager is designed to serve IP phones. It is not designed to serve other network devices (such as PCs). Although it is a good solution for DHCP for smaller networks, it is not designed to support larger networks with more than 1000 phones.

Multiple DHCP services can be configured per the Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster. The DHCP monitor service can be activated on multiple servers, and each server can be configured to serve multiple subnets.

## Network Services: DNS

Cisco Unified Communications Manager can use DNS names (default) or IP addresses for system addressing.

|**Advantages of Using IP Addresses**|**Advantages of Using DNS**|
|---|---|
|Does not require a DNS server.|Simplifies management because of the use of names instead of numbers|
|Prevents the IP telephony network from failing when the DNS server is unavailable.|Easier IP address changes because of name-based IP paths|
|Decreases the amount of time required when a device attempts to contact the Cisco Unified Communications Manager server.|Server-to-IP phone NAT possible|
|Simplifies troubleshooting|Possibility to have redundant IP phone services|

## Network Services: TFTP

The TFTP file systems can hold several file types, such as the following:

- **Phone configuration files:** contains a list of prioritized Cisco Unified Communications Managers the phone will register with.
- **Phone firmware files:** The TFTP server stores the current versions of firmware needed for the phone models in the network. This version is checked when the phone boots and the correct version is downloaded from the TFTP if the phone is not already on the correct version.
- **Certificate Trust List (CTL) and Identity Trust List (ITL) files:** : When a CTL or ITL file is present, the IP phone requests a signed TFTP configuration file from the Cisco Unified Communications Manager TFTP server. This file allows the phone to verify that the configuration file came from a trusted source.
- **Network and User localization files:** Network locales specify country-specific tones and cadences; user locales specify the language to use for text displays.
- **Ringer files:** Different ring tones can be downloaded from the TFTP server.
- **Softkey files:** These files contain the softkey templates that will be used by the phone.
- **Dial plan files for SIP phones:** SIP phones download their dial plans directly onto the phone for dialed number processing.

## Note

Some newer phones use HTTP protocol (port 6970), which is much faster than TFTP.
