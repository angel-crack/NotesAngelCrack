Each Cisco Unified Communications Manager server is defined as a publisher or subscriber at the time of the installation.

Within a Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster, there can only be one publisher. The first server (node) to be installed and is the creator of the cluster and owner of the database. If the cluster has more than 1250 users, it is highly recommended to have a dedicated publisher, which is not running any other services.

Additional servers are added to the cluster as subscriber servers. Subscribers receive a copy of the database from the publisher. There can be no more than 20 servers (nodes) within a cluster. Up to a maximum of eight servers (nodes) can run the Cisco CallManager service, allowing them to provide call processing for the cluster.

A subscriber can also be configured as a Media Resource Server, which provides media services, such as conferencing and music on hold to endpoints and gateways. These types of media resource services are provided by the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application service, which can be enabled on any server node in the cluster.

Media resources include:

- **Music on Hold (MOH):** Provides multicast or unicast music to devices that are placed on hold, or temporary hold, transferred, or added to a conference.

- **Annunciator service:** Provides announcements in place of tones to indicate incorrectly dialed numbers or call routing unavailability (reorder tone).

- **Conference bridges:** Provides software-based conferencing for instant and permanent conferences.

- **Media Termination Point (MTP) services:** Provide features for H.323 clients, H.323 trunks, and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) endpoints and trunks.

The decision on how many subscribers are needed in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster depends on the following factors:

- **Redundancy:** Backup requirement in case of failure.
- **Load Sharing:** Splitting the load between servers.
- **Scalability:** How many phones will be supported in the network.

A TFTP server is required to serve configuration files and firmware updates to IP phones, gateways, and other devices. The TFTP can run on any server in the cluster. However, if the cluster has more than 1250 users, it is highly recommended to have a dedicated server for TFTP services. For high availability, up to two TFTP servers can be deployed.

## Clusters – Publisher Replication

![[Pasted image 20241104131016.png]]

There are a few different replication scenarios within a cluster. The first is a mechanism for distributing the database that contains all the device configuration information. The configuration database is stored on the publisher node, and a copy is replicated to the subscriber nodes within the cluster. Database changes are made on the publisher and are then communicated to the subscribers who have a read-only copy of the database, thus ensuring that the configuration is consistent across the members of the cluster and facilitating spatial redundancy of the database.

In the event of a publisher failure, certain changes cannot be made to the configuration, given that the only node with rights to add, delete, or modify configuration is the publisher. If a subscriber fails, its database will become out of sync with the publisher. When the subscriber comes back online, it will sync all missed changes from the publisher.

## Clusters – User Facing Features (UFF)

The second method of replication concerns the distribution of User Facing Features (UFF). User-facing features are interactions that the user has with the system, for example: setting Call Forward All to redirect all calls to another number. Database modifications for user-facing call-processing features are made on the subscriber nodes to which an end-user device is registered. The subscriber nodes replicate UFF database modifications to all the other nodes in the cluster, providing redundancy for the user-facing features.

In the event of a failure (any node), all changes made during the outage will be replicated to the failed node after it comes back online.

## Intracluster Communication

The third method of data replication is the propagation of Call Detail Records (CDRs) and Call Management Records (CMRs). Data is collected by the subscribers (if they are enabled for CDRs and CMRs) and uploaded to the publisher periodically. During periods when the publisher is unreachable, the CDRs and CMRs are stored on the local hard disk of the subscriber. When connectivity is re-established with the publisher, all outstanding CDRs are uploaded to the publisher, which stores the records in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager CDR Analysis and Reporting (CAR) database.

The final method for replicating data, is called Intra-Cluster Communication Signaling (ICCS). This process involves the propagation and replication of run-time data such as registration of devices, locations bandwidth, and shared media resources. This information is shared across all members of a cluster running the Cisco CallManager service (call-processing subscribers), and it ensures the optimum routing of calls between members of the cluster and associated gateways.
