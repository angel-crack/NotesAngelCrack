This topic discusses the main requirements of a network running collaboration technologies.
## Impact of User Applications on the Network

Real-time data such as voice and video traffic have different network characteristics to traditional network traffic such as email. Real-time data is time-sensitive. There is no good trying to have a conversation with someone when you have to wait several minutes for a reply. In fact, even a few seconds wait makes a conversation disjointed.

## Quality Issues in the Network

The four main network issues that cause problems with real-time data include:

- **Bandwidth:** Large graphic files, multimedia uses, and increasing use of voice and video can cause bandwidth capacity problems over data networks. Multiple traffic flows compete for a limited amount of bandwidth and may require more bandwidth than is available.
- **Latency:** Latency or delay is the time that it takes for a packet to reach the receiving endpoint after being transmitted by the sender. This period of time is called the end-to-end delay and consists of variable delay components (processing and queueing delay) and fixed delay components (serialization and propagation delay). Too much delay makes communication virtually impossible. Typically delay over 150ms end-to-end will be noticeable to an end-user.
- **Jitter:** Jitter is the variation in end-to-end delay that is experienced between packets in the same flow as they traverse the network. This delta in end-to-end delay for any two packets is the result of the variable network delay. Variation in end-to-end delay becomes harder for codecs to deal with, and even a variance of 40ms will become noticeable to users.
- **Packet loss:** Packet loss in a real-time data flow does not get retransmitted, primarily because, by the time the packet was to be resent, it would be far too late. Voice and video calls can tolerate some packet loss, but this should be kept below 1 percent to avoid noticeable quality issues.


## Quality of Service

The goal of QoS is to provide a better and more predictable network service by providing dedicated bandwidth, controlled jitter and latency, and improved loss characteristics as required by the business applications. QoS gives priority to some sessions over other sessions. Packets of delay-sensitive sessions bypass queues of packets belonging to nondelay-sensitive sessions. When queue buffers overflow, packets are dropped on the session that can recover from the loss or those sessions that can be eliminated with minimal business impact.

QoS is not a substitute for bandwidth. If the network is congested, packets will be dropped. QoS allows the administrators control on how, when, and what traffic is dropped during congestion. No amount of QoS will help if there simply is not enough bandwidth, to begin with.

Any network carrying real-time traffic needs good QoS across the network to manage bandwidth, jitter, latency, and packet loss to the levels that real-time data can deal with. It is worth noting that the internet has no QoS, so any real-time data packets using the internet will be treated on a first-in, first-out basis.

A QoS policy is a definition of the QoS levels that are assigned across a network. In a converged network, having a QoS policy is as important as having a security policy. A written and public QoS policy allows users to understand and negotiate for QoS in the network.

1. Identify traffic and its requirements
2. Divide traffic into classes
3. Define QoS policies for each class

There are three basic steps that are involved in defining QoS policies for a network:

1. Identify traffic and its requirements. Study the network to determine the type of traffic running on the network and then determine the QoS requirements for the different types of traffic. The figure shows a network traffic discovery identifying voice, video, and data traffic.
2. Group the traffic into classes with similar QoS requirements. For example, the voice and video traffic are put into dedicated classes, and all of the data traffic is put into a best-effort class.
3. Define QoS policies that will meet the QoS requirements for each traffic class. In the example in the figure, the voice traffic is given top priority and always transmitted first. The video traffic is transmitted after voice but before the best-effort traffic that is only transmitted when no other traffic is present.


## Security and Redundancy

Secure and redundant networks are essential for any traffic type, including real-time data. Real-time data within the network has no additional security and redundancy needs at a network level; however, voice VLANs are recommended to maintain separation between different traffic types.
