From the main web page, you can click to access the administration GUI interface or the Self Care Portal for end users. If you are using the Self Care Portal within your organization, you may want to create a DNS record that points at the end-user pages so end users can go directly to this page.

Clicking the Cisco Unified Communications Manager option from the initial menu brings you into the main administration tool. There are six main administration tools available from the top right navigation menu. After an option is selected, the appropriate username and password for that tool must be entered. Different tools can have different access requirements, so an administrator may not have access to all tools.

The tools available in the main navigation window include:

- **Cisco Unified Reporting:** The Cisco Unified Reporting web application generates consolidated reports for troubleshooting or inspecting cluster data. The tool gathers data from existing sources, compares the data, and reports irregularities. When you generate a report in Cisco Unified Reporting, the report combines data from one or more sources on one or more servers into one output view.
- **Cisco Unified CM Administration:** This is the main administration window where you will spend most of your time. From here, manage phones, users, call routing, and media resources, for example.
- **Disaster Recovery System:** Create and restore backups and create backup schedules.
- **Cisco Unified Serviceability:** Turn on and off services for each node in the cluster. Services can also be restarted when required.
- **Cisco Unified OS Administration:** Manage the underlying operating system and review settings configured at installation.
- **Cisco Unified IM and Presence Reporting:** Reporting tools specific to the Cisco Unified IM and Presence servers in the cluster.
