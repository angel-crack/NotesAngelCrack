In this topic, you will discover the credentials needed for authentication and the method available for authentication from Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

## Passwords

Cisco Unified Communications Manager end-user passwords can contain any alphanumeric ASCII character and all ASCII special characters.

| Invalid Non-Trivial Password Examples | Description|
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| cisco1359 | Must contain three of the four allowable characteristics: uppercase character, lowercase character, number, symbol |
| C1$c0000  | Must not use a character or number more than three times consecutively |
| 20012001  | Must not repeat or include the alias, username, or extension number|
| 654321 or ABCDEF  | Cannot consist of consecutive characters or numbers|

The system provides trivial credential checks to disallow credentials that are easily hacked. Administrators enable trivial credential checks by checking the Check for Trivial Passwords check box in the Credential Policy Configuration window.

A nontrivial password meets the following criteria:

- Must contain three of the four allowable characteristics: uppercase character, a lowercase character, number, or symbol.

- Must not use a character or number more than three times consecutively.

- Must not repeat or include the alias, username, or extension.

- Cannot consist of consecutive characters or numbers. For example, passwords such as 654321 or ABCDEFG.


In the figure, the first example is valid, whereas the last three are not.

To control password requirements such as password length, expiration date, and other requirements, a credential policy can be created. There are three default credential policies in Cisco Unified Communications Manager:

- End-User Password

- End-User PIN

- Application User Password


Administrators can assign a new default credential policy and configure new default credentials after installation. These new credential policies may be for the system or assigned to users.

## PINs

Cisco Unified Communications Manager end users can access phone features (such as Call Forwarding) from their PC via GUI using their user and password credentials. When using the telephony user interface, a PIN is used instead.

|Invalid PIN Examples|Description|
|---|---|
|2011165|Must not use the same number more than two times consecutively|
|2001|Must not repeat or include the user extension or mailbox, or the reverse of the user extension or mailbox|
|121212|Must contain three different numbers|
|24726 (cisco)|Must not match the numeric representation for the first or last name of the user (not dial by name) or company name|
|408408 2580 or 159 or 753|Must not contain groups of repeated digits or patterns that are dialed in a straight line on a keypad|

The Cisco Unified Communications Manager end-user PIN can contain digits 0 to 9 only. A nontrivial PIN meets the following criteria:

- Must not use the same number more than two times consecutively.

- Must not repeat or include the user extension or mailbox or the reverse of the user extension or mailbox.

- Must contain three different numbers; for example, a PIN such as 121212 is trivial.

- Must not match the numeric representation (that is, dial by name) for the first or last name of the user.

- Must not contain groups of repeated digits, such as 408408, or patterns that are dialed in a straight line on a keypad, such as 2580, 159, or 753.


## LDAP Synchronization

When Cisco Unified Communications Manager is configured for LDAP synchronization, all user accounts that are stored in the LDAP database are replicated to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. This behavior can be controlled by using filters.

![[Pasted image 20241105183843.png]]

The User Administration menu in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager can still be used to control the password and PIN for the user, as well as a few other parameters, but a lot of the information is only modifiable through LDAP and not inside the User administration pages.

All information available in the LDAP database is replicated to Cisco Unified Communications Manager except the password, which is defined locally on Cisco Unified Communications Manager, and as LDAP does not have native support for a PIN number, the PIN needs to be set locally on Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

The LDAP synchronization process uses a service called directory synchronization (DirSync) on Cisco Unified Communications Manager to synchronize several users attributes from a corporate LDAP directory.

When this feature is enabled, users are automatically provisioned from the corporate directory in the following ways:

- periodic synchronization schedule

- immediate synchronization upon request


## Note

Only end users are synchronized; application users are not synchronized.

## LDAP Authentication

LDAP authentication is used to authenticate users against the LDAP directory instead of having passwords stored in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager database.

![[Pasted image 20241105183923.png]]


LDAP synchronization is not mandatory but is recommended. Personal user data can be managed in LDAP and replicated into the Cisco Unified Communications Manager database if LDAP synchronization is enabled. User data can be managed and stored locally by the Cisco Unified Communications Manager database if LDAP synchronization is not enabled.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager user data such as associated PCs or controlled devices are always stored in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager database for each individual user. As a consequence, the username must be known in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager database to assign Cisco Unified Communications Manager user settings to the user. Also, the username must be known in the LDAP directory to assign the password to the user. If LDAP synchronization is not used, an identical user account must be configured in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager database and LDAP.

Using Cisco Unified Communications Manager and LDAP authentication, the management of user accounts is accomplished through a central LDAP corporate directory. Ideally, authentication is used with LDAP synchronization.

## Note

Application users do not use LDAP authentication.

## Authentication Methods

The table shows where user data are stored without LDAP integration, when using LDAP synchronization, and when using LDAP authentication. Without LDAP integration, all end-user data are stored in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager database and configured via Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration.

If using LDAP synchronization, personal and organizational settings are configured and stored in LDAP. When Cisco Unified Communications Manager synchronizes with the LDAP server, the data is replicated to the Cisco Unified Communications Manager database. However, as long as LDAP synchronization is enabled, this data cannot be modified in Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

User passwords and Cisco Unified Communications Manager configuration settings are still configured using Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration and stored in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager database.

When using LDAP authentication, user passwords are controlled by the LDAP database. Cisco Unified Communications Manager configuration settings are still configured using Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration and stored in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager database only.

## Note

Application user accounts are always controlled by Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration and stored in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager database.

## Associating Users, Phones and Lines

Users, phones, and lines are associated with each other in multiple places.

On the user page, you can create a link to a device for control purposes. This is required for features like Jabber and desk phone control. On the device page, you can select the user. This setting is used for licensing. On the line page, you can associate the line with the user. This setting is used for presence information.
