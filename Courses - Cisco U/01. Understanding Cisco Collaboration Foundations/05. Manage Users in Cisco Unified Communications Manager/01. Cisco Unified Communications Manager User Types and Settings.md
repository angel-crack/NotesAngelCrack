In this topic, you will explore the different types of accounts that exist in Cisco Unified Communications Manager, where to create them, and how to change privilege levels.

## User Account Types

|End Users|Application Users|
|---|---|
|Associated with an individual person|Associated with an application|
|For personal use in interactive logins|For noninteractive logins|
|Used for user features and individual administrator logins|Used for application authorization|
|Included in the user directory|Not included in the user directory|
|Can be provisioned and authenticated using an external directory service, such as LDAP|Cannot use LDAP|

There are two types of user accounts in Cisco Unified Communications Manager:

- **End users:** All end users are associated with a physical person and an interactive login. This category includes all IP telephony users and Cisco Unified Communications Manager administrators. These user accounts can be configured on external database applications such as a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server. End-user accounts can also be configured locally on Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
- **Application users:** All application users are associated with Cisco Unified Communications features or applications, such as Cisco Unified Contact Center Express or Cisco Unified Communications Manager Assistant. These applications need to authenticate with Cisco Unified Communications Manager, but as there is no human associated with these "users," they do not have an interactive login. These accounts are used to allow applications to authenticate for internal communications between each other. Application users cannot be configured on an external database such as LDAP. As such, each application user must be created locally on Cisco Unified Communications Manager.


## User Account Creation

End-user accounts can be created in several ways:

- **Manually:** End user accounts can be manually created on Cisco Unified Communications Manager via the User Management menu.
- **Imported:** If the user accounts exist in another database, they can be exported from that database and then imported into Cisco Unified Communications Manager. There are a few methods to achieve this importation, but the most common is the use of the Bulk Administration Tool (BAT).
- **Replicated:** Most organizations make use of an LDAP server, the most common being Microsoft Active Directory. This LDAP server already contains the entire employee database for the company, and integrating Cisco Unified Communications Manager and the LDAP server, by way of replication, is often the easiest and best way to manage user accounts from a single centralized location. Although often the first choice for most companies, it will only support end-user accounts and has no support for application user accounts, which will still need to be created locally on Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

## User Account Roles

Each user is assigned a certain role. Each role comprises resources for a particular application. Different applications have different privilege levels that can be set for their respective resources.

For example, Resources in the Cisco Communications Manager Administration application are assigned with one of the following privileges: No Access, Read (View), and Update (full access). Other applications, such as Cisco Extension Mobility or Cisco Unified Serviceability, specify their own access privileges to their resources.

The access privileges for Cisco Unified Communications Manager Applications are:

- **Read:** The read access privilege specifies that users can view only the windows that the resource comprises but cannot modify the parameters in the windows. Buttons such as Insert, Delete, Update, and Reset does not display.
- **Update:** The update access privilege specifies that users can view and change the parameters in the windows that the resource comprises. Users with update privileges can perform operations such as Insert, Delete, Update, and Reset, as well as executive functions that can start or stop a process or service from the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Serviceability windows.

## Custom Roles

Cisco Unified Communications Manager has prebuilt roles by default. These roles can be used as is or can be customized to further fulfill the administration requirements. In some cases, it might make more sense for the administrator to create a new custom role for a particular requirement.

A role will be linked to an application, which in turn has resources that can be controlled individually for different access rights.

In the figure, two custom roles have been configured, one for the Cisco CallManager Administration application and one for the Cisco CallManager Dialed Number Analyzer application. Within these two applications, the administrator can define the read or update permission for each resource.

When creating a new role, the first step is defining which application the role will be associated with. Custom roles can be defined for these applications:

- **Cisco CallManager AXL database:** Application programming interface (API) used to insert, retrieve, update or remove data from Cisco Unified Communications Manager. The web GUI also interfaces with this API for database access which is why you see the service running.
- **Cisco CallManager Serviceability:** Used to start and stop services on a Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
- **Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration:** Used to administer Cisco Unified Communications Manager via a web interface.
- **Cisco CallManager Dialed Number Analyzer:** Tool used to see how calls will be routed within Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
- **Cisco Unified Communications Manager Instant Messaging and Presence (IM&P) Administration:** Used to administer Cisco IM&P via a web interface.
- **Cisco CallManager End User:** End-user administration.
- **Cisco Computer Telephony Integration (CTI):** Enables devices to control your phone.
- **Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM&P Reporting:** Provides reporting tools for Cisco IM&P.
- **Cisco Unified Reporting:** Provides reporting tools for Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
- **Cisco Extension Mobility:** Application enabling users to log into any phone and receive personalized dialing and settings.


## Access Control Group

There are various default Access Control Groups that are predefined and have no members that are assigned to them at installation time. The Cisco Unified Communications Manager Super User or a user with access to user group configuration might add users to these groups. Additional groups can be added as needed per the requirements of the company security policy.

![[Pasted image 20241105183216.png]]

The "Standard CCM Super Users" have full access permission to all roles. This access control group cannot be deleted and contains the Administrator account that was created during installation. Additional users can only be added or removed from this group as required.

A user can belong to multiple access control groups, which can be associated with multiple roles. In the example, User 1 belongs to Group 1 but could also belong to Group 2 depending on the permission required. Group 1 has been assigned to Role 1 but could also be assigned to Role 2. The granularity gives the administrator the freedom to design any type of security policy that fits the organization. If all users in a group need access to multiple roles, assigning multiple roles to a group would be the best design. If, however, a single user needs more privileges compared to his colleagues, adding the user to multiple groups would be a better design.

To further control the permissions when users are added to multiple groups or groups are associated with multiple roles, there is an enterprise parameter called "Effective Access Privileges for Overlapping User Groups and roles." This enterprise parameter determines the level of user access for users that have conflicting privileges. This enterprise parameter can be set to the following values:

- **Maximum:** The effective privilege represents the maximum of the privileges of all the overlapping user groups. Maximum is the default.
- **Minimum:** The effective privilege represents the minimum of the privileges of all the overlapping user groups. This enterprise parameter does not affect the privileges for the members of the Standard CCM Super Users user group.

## Design Example

The example in the figure involves designing access rights for users with standard default roles.

![[Pasted image 20241105183225.png]]

A new Access Control Group named "Custom Administrator Group" has been created and associated with the Standard CCM Gateway Management, Standard CCM Phone Management, and Standard CCM User Management roles. These roles are default roles that have preset permissions for their corresponding resources.

The Custom Administrator Group has not been associated with any other roles. Therefore, all other menus are denied implicitly.

The result is that the users in the new group are able to configure phones, users, and gateways with no access to any other menu.
