This topic provides an overview of the CoS options available in Cisco Unified Communications Manager with an emphasis is on partitions and calling search spaces (CSS).

## CoS Planning: Calling Privileges

CoS is an important dial plan component. Sometimes called "calling privileges," it is used to implement control of access to the dial plan so that not all users can access all call routing table entries all the time.

Nontechnical issues such as the business needs of an organization usually drive these requirements.

For example, all employees may require full PSTN access including international dialing, while other phones, such as the lobby phone, require emergency PSTN access only. This scenario shows a need for two distinct classes of service: one for the employees and another for the lobby phone users.

Careful planning is required to list the desired reachable destinations for each calling device.

## CoS Planning: ToD Routing

CoS can be used for special applications like routing calls with the same number differently at different times of the day using multiple PSTN service providers that offer different pricing at different times during the day.

For example, PSTN Provider A might be the most cost effective for international calls between 8:00 and 14:00, while Provider B is the more cost effective the rest of the day.

## CoS Planning: Local Breakout

CoS can also be used to route calls differently for different users based on location. Routing calls with the same number to use a different gateway per branch site for example. Although the users are permitted to dial the numbers, the breakout location should be different to keep the calls localized to the site.

## CoS Configuration Elements

The table lists the Cisco Unified Communications Manager configuration elements that are used for calling privilege implementation, along with their characteristics.

The main features used to implement CoS are partitions and calling search spaces. Additional CoS features are available to allow various calling privilege implementations that are based on the individual needs of the customer.

The Cisco Unified Communications Manager configuration elements used for calling privileges include:

- **Partitions**: A partition is a group of destination numbers with similar reachability characteristics (directory numbers, route patterns, translation patterns, and so on).
- **Calling search spaces**: A CSS is a list of (destination) partitions that are accessible from a particular (source) device.
- **Time schedules and time periods**: Time schedules and time periods are used to allow certain partitions to be reachable only during a certain time of the day.
- **Client Matter Codes**: CMCs are used to track calls to certain numbers for call accounting and billing. CMCs force the user to enter a code to specify that the call relates to a specific client matter. The CMC is assigned to users, such as customers, departments, or individuals. When configured, the user must enter the client code to track their calls for accounting or billing purposes. For example, to track that the Sales department has made a call, each salesperson must enter the CMC assigned to Sales. The CMC is used only for tracking purposes; it is not used to restrict access. However, to maintain accurate accounting and billing information, a call will be allowed only if a valid CMC is entered.
- **Forced Authorization Codes**: FACs are used to restrict outgoing calls to certain numbers. A user must enter an authorization code to reach the number. For example, a code must be entered to permit international dialing. If FACs are combined with CMCs, then both codes need to be entered.

|Call Privilege Element|Characteristics|
|---|---|
|Partitions|Defines a group of numbers (directory numbers, route patterns, translation patterns, etc.) with similar reachability characteristics.|
|Calling search space (CSS)|Defines which partitions are accessible to a particular device.|
|Time Schedules and Time Periods|Allows certain partitions to be reachable only during a certain time of the day.|
|Client Matter Codes (CMC)|Tracks calls to certain numbers. A user must enter a client code to track calls to certain clients.|
|Forced Authorization Codes (FAC)|Restricts outgoing calls to certain numbers. A user must enter an authorization code to reach the number.|

## Note

Some devices, features, and applications do not support CMCs and FACs. These applications or features; like call-forwarding, require FAC- and CMC-free route patterns for calling.

## Partitions and Calling Search Spaces

A partition is a logical group of destination dial patterns. For example, all employee phones may be assigned to a single partition. A source device can only reach destinations that are defined in its calling search space which is a list of reachable partitions.

In the figure, three partitions for users have been created.

- **Lobby_PT:** For all Lobby phones.
- **Employee_PT:** For general employee usage.
- **Manager_PT:** For all manager phones.

![[Pasted image 20241105214801.png]]

In addition to the partitions created for the user’s phones, three partitions have been created for the Route Patterns for external calls.

- **911_PT:** Used by the emergency route pattern.
- **National_PT:** Used by the route pattern for national calls.
- **International_PT:** Used by the route pattern for international calls.

A calling search space is a list of partitions that can be reached by a particular user. In the figure, the Lobby phones have a CSS that lists the 911_PT partition. This setup allows the Lobby phones to call only the Emergency number. The Lobby phone would not be able to call any other numbers in the company, not even other Lobby phones, as lobby phones belong to the Lobby_PT partition which is not listed in the CSS.

![[Pasted image 20241105214814.png]]


Based on the CSS in this example, the Employee phones would be able to call:

- Lobby phones (Lobby_PT partition)
- Other employees (Employee_PT)
- Emergency numbers (911_PT)
- National numbers (National_PT)

The Employee phones would not be able to call the following:

- Managers (Manager_PT)
- International numbers (International_PT)


![[Pasted image 20241105214840.png]]


Finally, the Manager phones would have no restrictions as all six partitions are listed in their calling search space.

## Note

It’s important to understand that the partition an entity belongs to does not affect its dialing permission. The permission is controlled by the CSS of the source entity and the partition of the destination entity.

![[Pasted image 20241105214849.png]]

By default, all entities that can be configured with a partition are in the partition < None >. All entities that can be configured with a CSS are assigned CSS < None > by default.

Members of partition < None > (also called the null partition) are always accessible by sources of a call routing request, regardless of the CSS of that call routing source.

Entities that do not have a CSS assigned (for example, CSS < None >) can only access call routing targets that are in partition < None >.

## Note

By default, no partitions and CSSs are assigned, and all entities are associated with the null partition and CSS < None >. Therefore, by default, all calls are possible for all calling sources to all destinations.

## Call Privileges Example

The table shows a typical CoS implementation with calling classes and their allowed destinations. These calling classes can then be assigned to devices or users.

|Calling Privilege Class (CoS)|Allowed Destinations|
|---|---|
|Internal|Internal, Emergency|
|Local|Internal, Emergency, Local PSTN|
|Long Distance|Internal, Emergency, Local PSTN, Long Distance PSTN|
|International|Internal, Emergency, Local PSTN, Long Distance PSTN, International PSTN|

In the example, the Internal class allows only internal and emergency calls. The Local class adds permission for local PSTN calls. The Long Distance class also allows long-distance PSTN calls, and the International class also enables international PSTN calls.

## Note

The call privileges should be set according to the current cost of calls. For example, if national costs are free, you only need to build two classes: long-distance except mobile calls and international calls including mobile calls.

## Line and Device Calling Search Spaces for IP Phones

CSSs can be assigned to both the physical phone (device) and the line. First, consider what would happen if you were to implement either Device Mobility or Extension Mobility. Do you want your calling permissions to stay with the line regardless of which phone a user has logged into or do you want permissions to stay with the device regardless of who is using the phone?

![[Pasted image 20241105214903.png]]

A CSS can be set at both the line and the device. If this is the case, then the list of partitions from the line and the device are put into a single list of accessible partitions with the partitions listed in the line above those listed in the device. If a dialed number matches more than one partition, then the closest match will be used. If the match is the same, then the partitions are searched in order starting with the line then the device.
