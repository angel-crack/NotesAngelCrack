This topic describes PoE.

## Power over Ethernet

PoE

- Less cabling
- Power backup
- Less installation cos
- Lower energy costs

PoE is one of the most widely deployed technologies to provide power to networked devices, with the following primary benefits:

- High availability for power and guarantees uninterrupted services, a requirement for critical applications such as emergency 911 calls.
- Lower operating expenses by providing network resiliency at a lower cost by consolidating backup power into the wiring closet.
- Faster deployment of new campus access networking infrastructures by eliminating the need for a power outlet for every endpoint.
- Combined with Cisco EnergyWise and Energy-Efficient Ethernet, PoE helps meet corporate sustainability mandates while lowering energy costs.

## PoE Evolution

![[Pasted image 20241104154933.png]]

As the enterprise workspace evolves with more and more end devices for communication, collaboration, security, and productivity, the need for PoE is also evolving to support newer end devices with increased power requirements.

Cisco has been leading PoE technology since 2000; the first generation of Cisco prestandard PoE delivered up to 7W over the Ethernet cables that transport data traffic.

In June 2003, the IEEE approved a standard, IEEE 802.3af, for PoE technology. The standard specified a 15.4W maximum power delivery from the network device, also known as Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE), to an end device, also known as a Powered Device (PD). The average maximum power available to the PD is 12.95W after accounting for cable loss.

The Cisco Catalyst 4500E was the first Ethernet switch in the industry to introduce 30W PoE technology in 2007, two years before the IEEE 802.3at standard introduction. The 802.3at standard was more commonly known as PoE+ (PoE plus).

Cisco Universal Power over Ethernet (Cisco UPOE) leapfrogged the industry to provide 60W PoE per switch port in 2011 to enable new deployment options in next-generation workspace environments.

The IEEE again followed suit and released two new versions of PoE in 2018, namely:

- **802.3bt (Type 3):** Also known as 4PPoE; supports 60 watts per port
- **802.3bt (Type 4):** Capable of delivering 100 watts per port

## PoE: IEEE

When focusing on the IEEE standards, it is important to identify the difference between the power that is delivered from the PSE versus the power received by the PD. Due to cable loss, the power that is received by the PD will always be less than the power supported by the IEEE standard. For example, 802.3af supports 15 watts of power per port. When cables loss is taken into account, the power the PD device receives, on average, is 12.95 watts. The same is true for the other IEEE standards as depicted in the table.

The second thing to pay close attention to is the different requirements in wiring. There are three different deployment options for PoE from a wiring standpoint.

- **Mode A:** This delivers the power on pins 1,2,3,6. These are the same pins that are used to send data to the endpoints. The other 4 pins in the cable are not used.
- **Mode B:** While the data is sent through pins 1,2,3,6, the power is sent down the “spare” pins, 4,5,7,8.
- **4-pair mode:** All eight pins (four pairs) are used to deliver the power.

## Note

It is important to understand which pins are used to deliver power as in past years. Cabling installers would often only test the data pins (1,2,3,6). This causes problems when connecting a powered device that requires “spare” pins (4,5,7,8).

## PoE: Power Classes

|Power Class|PSE Output Power|PD Input Power|PD Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|15.4|12.95|802.3af—Type 1 PoE|
|1|4|3.84|802.3af—Type 1 PoE|
|2|7|6.49|802.3af—Type 1 PoE|
|3|15.4|12.49|802.3af—Type 1 PoE|
|4|30|25.5|802.3at—Type 2 PoE+|
|5|45|40|802.3bt—Type 3 4PPoE|
|6|60|51|802.3bt—Type 3 4PPoE|
|7|75|62|802.3bt—Type 4|
|8|100|73|802.3bt—Type 4|

PoE breaks PD and PSEs into different types and classes depending on the amount of power required or power deliverable.

While the power class is granular for identifying the exact amount of power delivered or consumed, the power type defines the maximum amount of power supported and the IEEE Standard that is supported by the device.

Powered devices types:

- **Type 1:** Support a maximum of 15.4 watts and are 802.3af compliant.
- **Type 2:** Support a maximum of 30 watts and are 802.3at compliant.
- **Type 3:** Support a maximum of 60 watts and are 802.3bt (Type 3) compliant
- **Type 4:** Support a maximum of 100 watts and are 802.3bt (Type 4) compliant.

## PoE: 7800/8800 Series Power Requirements

|IP Phone|Class 1 (4W / 3.84W)|Class 2 (7W / 6.49W)|Class 3 (15.4W / 12.49W)|Class 4 (30W / 25.5W)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|7800 Series|7811 7821 7841 7861|7832 Conference Phone|||
|8800 Series||8811 8841 8845|8831 Conference Phone 8832 Conference Phone|8851 8861 8865|

Following the power class and power types, you will look at an example. The Cisco IP phone 7811 is a Type 1 device, which means it supports the 802.3af standard of 15.4 watts, but the 7811 is a class 1 device that will consume a maximum of 3.84 watts of power.

The Cisco IP Phone 8865 is a Type 2 device that supports the 802.3at standard. As a class 4 device, it will consume no more than 25.5W of power. The 8865 will not use all the power unless it requires it, for example, when plugging external USB devices into the two USB ports on the device.

```

This output is from the command `show power inline` on a Cisco switch. It shows the total amount of power available, the used power, and the remaining power for additional devices. You can also identify that there are currently two devices that are consuming power via PoE. These devices are Cisco IP Phone 8865’s, which are plugged into ports Gi0/1 and Gi0/2. You will notice that although the 8865’s are class 4 devices which would require a maximum of 30W to be delivered by the PSE, the two phones are currently only consuming 14.7 W.
