**Cisco DX80:** Desktop SIP-based video endpoint that can be registered to Cisco Unified Communications Manager for on-premises call control or Cisco Webex Teams cloud-based call control. Cisco DX80 can be used as a monitor in addition to a video conferencing unit. It has no external remote or touch panel because the monitor itself is touch-based. Cisco DX80 has built-in speakers and a microphone and can be used with a wired or wireless headset.
**Cisco Webex Desktop Pro:** Similar to the Cisco DX80 but with a bigger 27-inch 4K monitor with built-in whiteboard capabilities and a separate stylus for writing on the screen.

## Room Video Endpoints

## Webex Board

|Cisco Webex Board 55|Cisco Webex Board 70|Cisco Webex Board 85|
|---|---|---|
|4K, multitouch, 55-inch screen|4K, multitouch, 70-inch screen|4K, multitouch, 85-inch screen|
|4K camera, 12-microphone array (with intelligent voice tracking)|   |   |
|Register with Webex Cloud, HCS, Cisco Unified Communications Manager, or Expressway|   |   |

**Presentation capabilities:** With the Cisco Webex Board, you can wirelessly present, whiteboard, video, or audio conference, and annotate shared content. Cisco Webex Board integrates the most common tools needed for team collaboration in physical meeting rooms into a single device. You can store everything you create on the Webex Board in the cloud and associate it with a virtual room. Team members can use the Cisco Webex Teams app to pick up where they left off in the physical room and continue working anywhere.

**Integration and analytics:** Proximity and ultrasound pairing technology enables the Webex Teams Board to automatically wakes up when you enter the room. It detects your Webex Teams app-supported device and suggests an activity, such as call, whiteboard, or presentation sharing.

**Audio and video:** A 4K camera captures a high-resolution, wide-angle image of nearly the entire room. A 12-microphone array automatically adapts sound quality when needed. Ideal for up to 10 people in a room.

**Registration:** Webex Teams Boards register to Cisco Webex Cloud, HCS, Cisco Unified Communications Manager, or Cisco Expressway.
