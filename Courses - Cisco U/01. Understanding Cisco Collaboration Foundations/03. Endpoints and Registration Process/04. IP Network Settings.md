In order for the endpoints to have network connectivity and reachability to Cisco Unified Communications Manager and other collaboration devices, the endpoint requires a few IP settings to be configured. This includes an IP address, Subnet Mask, default gateway, DNS Server IP address and domain name (in cases where DNS will be used in the solution), and possibly the most important setting – a scope option 150, which is the IP address of the TFTP server and the device that will provide the endpoint with its configuration files and firmware.

IP settings for endpoints can be configured in three primary ways.

- **DHCP:** The phone will query for a DHCP server which will respond with the configured settings on the DHCP scope. This solution is the most common, but it will only work if the DHCP server and the endpoint are in the same Layer 2 broadcast domain (VLAN).
- **DHCP relay:** Used in cases where the DHCP server and endpoint are on opposite sides of a router
- **Static:** The IP settings can be configured directly and statically on the endpoint. This is the least common approach as it can be an administrative burden to configure each endpoint and can often result in human error.

## IP Settings: DHCP

![[Pasted image 20241104161354.png]]
A DHCP server can be configured on many different devices. This can include the following:

- DHCP running on a server, such as Windows, Unix, or Linux.
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager: This is limited to solutions of 1000 endpoints and is limited to collaboration endpoints only, it is not designed to serve other network peripherals like computers and printers.
- Multilayer Switching (MLS): All Cisco MLS switches can be configured as a DHCP server.
- Router: All Cisco routers can be configured as a DHCP server.

The endpoint goes through a four-step process to obtain IP settings from a DHCP server.

1. **DHCP Discover:** This is a broadcast message sent to the entire broadcast domain asking a DHCP server to reply to the query. The source IP address used by the endpoint is 0.0.0.0
2. **DHCP Offer:** A DHCP in the same broadcast domain will receive the DHCP, discover the message and reply with a DHCP Offer message to the endpoint. This will include all configured settings on the DHCP server.
3. **DHCP Request:** The endpoint will acknowledge the DHCP offer by sending a DHCP Request message to the DHCP server using the offered IP address as its source address.
4. **DHCP Acknowledge:** The DHCP server will acknowledge the DHCP request message and record that the IP address has been issued to the endpoint in its internal database.

## DHCP Router Configuration

The figure depicts the DHCP configuration on a Cisco router and the DHCP configuration on a Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

![[Pasted image 20241104161416.png]]
Here is the breakdown of the Cisco router configuration.

- `ip dhcp excluded-address 10.1.5.1 10.1.5.149`: This command tells the DHCP server not to issue these IP addresses.
- `ip dhcp excluded-address 10.1.5.160 10.1.5.254`: This command is another excluded range of IP addresses.
- `ip dhcp pool Voice`: This command is used to enter into DHCP configuration mode and also to define the scope name—in this case, Voice.
- `network 10.1.5.0 255.255.255.0`: This command defines the scope of addresses that will be issued to clients and the subnet mask. In this example, the DHCP server will issue IP address 10.1.5.1 through to 10.1.5.254. The aforementioned excluded-address commands will prevent some of those addresses from being issued, allowing for those “reserved” addresses to be used by other devices statically, such as the default gateway and servers.
- `default-router 10.1.5.254`: This command is the IP address that endpoints will receive for use as their default gateway. Notice that this IP address is in the excluded-address range.
- `option 150 ip 10.1.5.5`: This command is the IP address that endpoints will receive for use as their TFTP server. This setting is vital in the collaboration design because the endpoints need to check their software versions and download their configuration from the TFTP server. Without this setting, endpoints will remain in a boot cycle.
- `dns-server 10.1.5.100`: This command defines the IP address of the DNS server.
- `domain-name cll-collab.internal`: This command is for the domain name of your organization as per your directory structure, such as Active Directory.
- `lease 8`: This command defines an eight-day lease duration. Endpoints will need to reapply to continue using their IP address after 50 percent of the lease duration (four days in this example). If an endpoint fails to renew within eight days, the DHCP server will remove the binding to that endpoint, and the IP address can be issued to another endpoint when needed.

## DHCP Cisco Unified Communications Manager Configuration

![[Pasted image 20241104161434.png]]

The DHCP configuration on Cisco Unified Communications Manager requires the same set of options. However, the key difference is the GUI interface rather than CLI, and that the scope is defined with a start and end range IP address, rather than the entire network and then requiring exclusion ranges to be defined.

## IP Settings: DHCP Relay

![[Pasted image 20241104161446.png]]

If the DHCP server is on the opposite side of a router, the DHCP discover message will fail. Since the DHCP discover message is a broadcast message, and routers do not allow the forwarding of broadcast messages, the DHCP server will never receive the discover message and therefore never respond with a DHCP offer.

In such cases, a DHCP relay will need to be configured. On a Cisco router this is as simple as entering the interface that faces the endpoint, `interface GigabitEthernet0/0`, and issuing the `ip helper-address 10.1.5.5` command (where 10.1.5.5 is the IP address of the DHCP Server).

The ip helper command configures the router to listen for DHCP Discover messages on the interface configured and forward these messages as Unicast messages directly to the DHCP server. When the DHCP server replies with the DHCP offer, the router will relay the message back to the endpoint. The same is true for the DHCP request, and DHCP acknowledges messages.

The DHCP relay command on a Cisco Nexus switch is slightly different. The command is `ip dhcp relay address 10.1.5.5` (where 10.1.5.5 is the IP address of the DHCP Server).

## IP Settings: Static

The screenshots show the IP address and Subnet Mask, the default router, and the TFTP server. Although DNS and domain names can also be configured statically, this has not been shown in the figuress above. **Settings > Network Settings** options. The screenshots show the IP address and Subnet Mask, the default router, and the TFTP server. Although DNS and domain names can also be configured statically, this has not been shown in the figuress above.

Static configuration is the least common method of configuration as it is time-consuming and can lead to errors. In the event where the company wishes to change VLANs or IP address segments, this becomes an administrative burden to change all IP settings on every phone. DHCP is the preferred solution because it solves the aforementioned problems.
