## Manually Adding the Cisco IP Communicator

Cisco IP Communicator is not a product usually used by end customers any more because Jabber provides a much better software client. From a lab perspective, however, Cisco IP Communicator behaves almost exactly the same way as a hardware phone, which means you can see how a hardware phone would work without the need to have a phone physically on your desk.

### Step 1


From PC-1, open Cisco IP Communicator found on the desktop.

### Step 2

Hover your mouse over the various buttons on the Cisco IP Communicator to see what each button does.

### Step 3



Click the **menu button** on the Cisco IP Communicator, then click **Preferences**

### Step 4



From the top tabs, click **Network**.

### Step 5



Select **Use this Device Name** radio button and enter **HQ-CIPC-1**.

### Step 6



Under the TFTP Servers section, click the **Use these TFTP servers** radio button and enter the IP address **10.1.5.5** if not already set. As the Cisco IP Communicator is running on a computer, it may not receive the option 150 address of the TFTP from the DHCP server.

### Step 7

Click **OK**.

### Step 8

Repeat the previous steps on PC-2, using the Device Name **HQ-CIPC-2**.

### Step 9



On the PC-1 Cisco IP Communicator, click the **Settings** button.

### Step 10



Click **4** on the phone keypad or select option **4** (Status) on the phone screen.

### Step 11



Click **1** on the phone keypad, or click option **1** (Status Messages), or click the **Select** softkey button. All three options have the same result.

### Step 12



Review the Status messages, which notify you about the files that have been searched for, which ones have failed, and which ones were successful. In order for these messages to make sense, you need to better understand the bootup process of the phone.

### Step 13



Phone Bootup Process

### Step 14



Again, review the Status Messages. Now that you have a better understanding of the file lookup process, if you look at the status messages again, you will see a message saying, “File Not Found:” and the name of your device. This message is displayed because the phone tried to download its configuration file from the TFTP server. There is no record for this phone because you have not yet added it to Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

### Step 15

The status messages will also show that the file “XMLDefault.cnf.xml” was used by the phone.

### Step 16



On PC-1, open Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox and navigate to **http://10.1.5.5:6970/XMLDefault.cnf.xml** This will show you the contents of the XMLDefault file.

### Step 17

Navigate to **https://10.1.5.5/ccmadmin** and log in with username (**Administrator**) and password (**C0ll@B**). Accept any certificate warnings.

### Step 18

Select **Device > Phone**.

### Step 19

Click **Add New**.

### Step 20



From the Phone Type drop-down menu, select **Cisco IP Communicator** and click **Next**.

### Step 21



From the device protocol drop-down menu, select **SIP** and click **Next**.

### Step 22



Use the following settings to add the phone.

- Device Name: **HQ-CIPC-1**
    
- Description: **Desktop 1 HQ SIP CIPC**
    
- Device Pool: **HQ**
    
- Phone Button Template: **Standard CIPC SIP**
    
    1. The phone button template determines what settings can be applied to the buttons on the right side of the phone screen. The default template you have selected allows for two directory numbers (extensions), and the remaining buttons can be allocated to speed dials. You will create your own Phone Button template later in this lab.
        
- Owner: **Anonymous (Public/Shared Space)**
    
    1. The owner allows you to associate the phone with a user. Since there are no user accounts on the system currently, associating this device to a user is not possible, so you will select **Anonymous**, allowing anyone to use this device.
        
- Device Security Profile: **Cisco IP Communicator – Standard SIP Non-Secure Profile**
    
    1. A Device Security Profile sets the parameters related to security and the communication between the phone and Cisco Unified Communications Manager. These settings will include the type of encryption (if any) and the port number used for communication. This default profile sets no encryption and sets the communication to TCP or UDP on port 5060 (the default port for SIP).
        
- SIP Profile: **Standard SIP Profile**
    
    1. The SIP profile defines all parameters for the behavior of SIP. This includes settings such as timers, SIP presentation during signaling, and dial string interpretation, just to mention a few of the many options.
        

## Note

A few of the compulsory settings that are needed to add a phone have not been discussed yet. This topic will be discussed in more detail in this lab, but for now, choose the default settings so that you can get the phone added.

### Step 23

Click **Save** and then click **OK** on the pop-up screen informing you about clicking the Apply Config button (you will do this later).

### Step 24



At the top left of the phone configuration, select **Line [1] – Add a new DN**.

### Step 25



Enter the following information for the directory number:

- Directory Number: **11001**
    
- Description: **Desktop 1 HQ SIP CIPC Line 1**
    
- Alerting Name: **John Doe**
    

## Note

The alerting name is used to display the name of the user rather than their directory number when calling other users in the company.

### Step 26



Click **Save**, then click **Go** from the Related Links drop-down menu.

### Step 27

Finally, click the **Apply Config** button, then click **OK** on the pop-up screen.

### Step 28



Minimize your browser so you can see your Cisco IP Communicator. If your phone is still showing the Status messages, click exit three times. You will now see your CIPC going through the registration process, and after some time and a few resets, the new extension you just created will be visible on the phone.

## Note

If the phone gets stuck on the Configuring IP message or does not re-register, you can force a restart of the phone by clicking settings and dialing *** * # * *** from the keypad. Or you can exit and reopen the Cisco IP Communicator.

### Step 29



Open the Status messages again (settings, option 4, option 1), and notice this time the configuration file used is called **HQ-CIPC-1.cnf.xml**. You may also need to click OK to restart the phone.

### Step 30

Add the second Cisco IP Communicator to Cisco Unified Communications Manager with the following information:

- Device Name: **HQ-CIPC-2**
    
- Description: **Desktop 2 HQ SIP CIPC**
    
- Device Pool: **HQ**
    
- Phone Button Template: **Standard CIPC SIP**
    
- Owner: **Anonymous (Public/Shared Space)**
    
- Device Security Profile: **Cisco IP Communicator – Standard SIP Non-Secure Profile**
    
- SIP Profile: **Standard SIP Profile**
    

### Step 31

Add a directory number on line 1 for the second phone with the following information:

- Directory Number: **11002**
    
- Description: **Desktop 2 HQ SIP CIPC Line 1**
    
- Alerting Name: **Jane White**
    

### Step 32

Check PC-2 has also gone through the phone restarts before continuing to the next step.

### Step 33



On the CIPC on PC-1, click either the line button or the speaker button to get a dial tone.

### Step 34

Dial the Directory number for Jane White (**11002**), open the CIPC on PC-2, and answer the call.

## Exploring Universal Device and Line Templates

As you have seen in the previous tasks, there are a lot of settings that can be configured for the device and for the lines.

Settings for phones and lines can be set at three main levels in Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

![[Pasted image 20241104162403 1.png]]

In the figure, you can see two examples, the Media Resource Group List and Location settings can be set at the device pool level and the device level. The device setting, if set, will overwrite the setting in the device pool.

Setting up templates before adding phones can significantly reduce the amount of time needed to add phones. Autoregistration reduces the time taken to add phones even further. Autoregistration allows you to add phones to the network, which will automatically register with Cisco Unified Communications Manager. There are two templates that are used during autoregistration to apply settings. These profiles are the Universal Device template and the Universal Line template. Before you configure autoregistration, you first look at where these templates are found and how you could change them if needed.

- **Universal Line template:** Applies settings to a line as it is created. After being created, settings are changed at the individual line level. Changes to the template after the line is created do not change lines already created.
    
- **Universal Device template:** Applies settings to a device as it is created. After being created, settings are changed at the individual device level. Changes to the template after the device is created do not change the devices already added.
    
- **Feature Group template:** Applies settings to a user as it is created. Changes to the template after the device is created do not change users already added. You will not be using this template in this lab as it is more applicable to adding users than devices/lines.
    

### Step 35



Select **User Management > User/Phone Add > Universal Device Template** from the main menu.

### Step 36



Click **Find** and then click **Auto-registration Template**.

### Step 37



Expand Device Settings and notice this is where you can configure the owner, or in the previous tasks, the Anonymous setting for the device. Take some time to explore some of the other settings that can be configured in the Universal Device template.

### Step 38



Select **User Management > User/Phone Add > Universal Line Template** from the main menu.

### Step 39



Click **Find**. Then, select **Sample Line Template with TAG usage examples**.

### Step 40

This template defines all the settings that will be applied to lines on the phone, such as the line description and Alerting Name. Take some time to explore some of the other settings that can be configured in the Universal Line template.

## Configuring Phone Button Templates

A Phone Button template defines what the buttons to the right of the IP phones can be configured for. In this lab, you will configure your own Phone Button template that allows three directory numbers to be associated with your Cisco IP Communicator instead of the default two.

![[Pasted image 20241104162427 1.png]]

### Step 41

From **Device > Phone** click the **HQ-CIPC-1** phone.

Notice that you can only add two Directory numbers (Line 1 and Line 2). Phone Button templates allow you to control what each button of the phone screen can be used for. The default setting allows for two lines, and the remainder of the buttons are used for Speed Dials. You will now configure a new Phone Button template so you can change this default setting.

### Step 42



Select **Device > Device Settings > Phone Button Template** and then click **Find**.

### Step 43



You can now see all the default Phone Button templates for each model of Cisco Phone. You will create your own Phone Button template by copying the existing CIPC template and modifying it. Since there are four pages of templates, it is easiest to find your current template by changing the search. Change the search drop-down menu to **contains**, enter **CIPC** in the search field, and click **Find**.

### Step 44

Two templates are now listed. Click the **copy icon** to the right of the **Standard CIPC SIP template**.

### Step 45



Change the Button Template name to **LearningAtCisco – CIPC SIP** and click **Save**.

### Step 46



A Cisco IP Communicator has a total of eight phone buttons, here you can see the option to change any of the eight buttons except the first button, which is always a line. Change the **third button to Line** and click **Save**.

### Step 47

Select **Device > Phone** from the main menu.

### Step 48



Click **HQ-CIPC-1**, then change the Phone Button template to your newly created one.

### Step 49

Click **Save**, then click **OK** on the notification about needing to Apply the Config for the settings to take effect.

### Step 50

Click **Apply Config**. Then, select **OK** on the notification screen.

### Step 51

Click **Reset**. Then, click **Reset** on the pop-up screen. Then, click **Close**.

### Step 52



Notice on the left menu, you are now able to configure button three as a Line.

### Step 53

Repeat the previous five steps for **HQ-CIPC-2**.

## Configure Softkey Templates

Softkey templates control what the button under the IP phone screen represents in different call states. For example, the buttons will represent different options when the phone is on-hook compared to when the user is on a call.

![[Pasted image 20241104162438 1.png]]

### Step 54



Select **Device > Device Settings > Softkey Templates**.

### Step 55



Click **Find**, then Copy the **Cisco User with Feature Hardkeys template**.

### Step 56



Change the new template name to **LearningAtCisco – User with Feature Hardkeys**.

### Step 57



Change the description to **L@C Standard template for phones – features (Hold, Transfer, etc.) on hardkeys**.

### Step 58

Click **Save**.

### Step 59



On the Related Links drop-down menu, Configure Softkey Layout is already selected, click **Go**.

### Step 60



Select **Immediate Divert (iDivert)** from the left side list and move it to the right side list column by clicking the **right arrow**. Click **Save**

## Note

The Immediate Divert (iDivert) feature allows you to immediately divert a call to a voice-messaging system. When the call gets diverted, the line becomes available to make or receive new calls. Although you have not configured Voicemail in this lab, this is a useful softkey button to add for future use.

### Step 61



From the Select a call state to configure drop-down, select **Connected**.

### Step 62



Select **Hold (Hold)** from the left side list and click the **right arrow** to move it to the right side list.

### Step 63



Select **Hold (Hold)** on the right side list and move it to the top of the list using the **up arrow**.

### Step 64



Select **Undefined (Undefined)** and move it to the bottom of the list using the **down arrow**.

### Step 65

Click **Save**.

Take some time to see what the other options are in the different call states. Notice that not all options are available for all states. For example, hold is not available under any other call state except for Connected.

### Step 66

Select **Device > Phone**.

### Step 67



Click **HQ-CIPC-1**, then change the Softkey template to your newly created one.

### Step 68

Click **Save**, then click **OK** on the pop-up notifying you about needing to click Apply Config.

### Step 69

Click **Apply Config**. Then, click **OK** on the pop-up window

### Step 70

Repeat the previous four steps for the **HQ-CIPC-2** phone.

### Step 71



From the phone list screen, select the check boxes next to both CIPC phones, then click **Reset Selected**.

### Step 72

On the pop-up screen, click **Restart**. This forces the phones to redownload the configuration file for the new Softkey template to be used. The Restart option does not require the phone to reboot and start the boot process again, which is the case with the Reset option. Click **Close**.

### Step 73



Minimize your browser to see your CIPC on the desktop and verify the iDivert softkey button is now visible.

## Making Bulk Changes

Cisco Unified Communications Manager has a number of other ways to add, modify and delete multiple phones or lines. In this task, you will modify all four phones using the Bulk Administration tools.

### Step 74



Select **Device > Phone** and notice the device pool for all four phones are set to HQ.

### Step 75



Select **Cisco Unified Serviceability** in the top-right navigation menu and click **Go**.

### Step 76



Select **Tools > Service Activation**.

### Step 77



From the Server drop-down list box, select **CUCM-PUB.CLL-COLLAB.INTERNAL—CUCM Voice/Video** and click **Go**.

### Step 78



In the Database and Admin Services area, check the check box corresponding to Cisco Bulk Provisioning Service and click **Save**. The window refreshes, and the Activation Status corresponding to Bulk Provisioning Service displays **Activated.**

### Step 79



Select **Cisco Unified CM Administration** from the top-right navigation menu and click **Go**.

### Step 80

Select **Bulk Administration > Phones > Update Phones > Query**.

### Step 81



Click **Find**.

### Step 82

Click **Next.**

### Step 83



Check the box next to Device Pool and select BRANCH 1 from the drop-down box. This will change all four phones to use the BRANCH 1 device pool.

### Step 84



At the top of the page, select the radio button to apply the configuration to the phones straight away. In a production environment, you would probably want to wait and apply the configuration out of hours.

### Step 85

Click **Submit.**

### Step 86



You need to activate the job from the Job Scheduler. Select **Bulk Administration > Job Scheduler** and click **Find**

### Step 87



Click the check box next to the job and click Activate Selected to run the job. The status of the job is now pending.

### Step 88



Click on the job ID to see the job details. Because this was such a short job, the status will probably already say completed but if not, refresh your screen until it does.

### Step 89



Select **Device > Phone** and notice the device pool for all four phones are now BRANCH 1

## Accessing the Phone GUI via a Web browser

There are two easy tools to use to help with troubleshooting phone bootup issues—the GUI on the phone and the built-in web server on the phone. These two tools can also be used to identify the current configuration and status of the phone. You have already accessed the phone GUI in order to verify that the XMLDefault.cnf.xml file was loaded, and then subsequently, you saw the correct file was loaded after you added the phone to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Now, take a look at the phone GUI to identify one of the most common bootup problems that you might face—an incorrect CTL on the phone. This problem most commonly occurs when a phone is moved from one Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster to another. The CTL file prevents the phone from registering to any Cisco Unified Communications Manager that is not on the list. If a phone is moved from one cluster to another, there will be a mismatch, and the file needs to be cleared in order for the phone to associate with a new Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

### Step 90



Click **Settings** on the phone. Then, select option **5** (Security Configuration).

### Step 91



Select option **4** (CTL File).

### Step 92



To unlock the phone configuration, press * * # on the phone keyboard. You will notice after about a second, the lock unlocks, and now there is a softkey button to **Erase**.

### Step 93



Click **Erase,** and the phone will now restart.

### Step 94

**Maximize** your browser, which should still be on the phone list screen. Under the IPv4 Address column, click the IP address of the **HQ-CIPC-1** phone.

### Step 95



Review the display. This is the built-in web server on each Cisco IP Phone. It allows you to validate settings, see statistics, and look for any error messages. Next, click **Network Configuration** on the left menu.

### Step 96



Here you can see the Hostname, IP Address, TFTP Server and Cisco Unified Communications Manager used by the phone. Take a moment to explore some of the other settings and menus of the phone web access.

## Configure a SFTP Server for Firmware Files

### Step 97



From the desktop on PC-1, open the Core FTP application.

### Step 98



Click **Setup**

### Step 99



Click **New**

### Step 100



Enter **10.1.5.200** in the Domain IP/Address field.

### Step 101



Click the **ellipses (...)** button next to Base Directory. Then, create a new directory in VMDK (C:) called **Firmware** then click **OK**.

### Step 102



Select the **SSH/SFTP** check box.

### Step 103

Leave all other settings as default and click **OK**. Click OK when presented with the message: Domain changes will not go into effect until the server is restarted.

### Step 104



Select your newly created Domain and click **New** in the users section.

### Step 105



Enter the username (**Administrator**) and password (**C0ll@B**). Then, select the **ellipses (...)** next to the Home directory field, and select the **Firmware** folder you created earlier.

### Step 106



Change the **Idle Timeout** to **0 seconds** (this will disable the timeout), then click **OK** twice.

### Step 107

Click **Start** to activate the SFTP server.

### Step 108



Open Google Chrome and navigate to **http://10.1.5.100** accepting any security warnings. Click on **Phone_Firmware** which will show a file named **cmterm-78xx.12-1-1-12.k3.cop.sgn**. Right-click the file and select **Save link As**.

### Step 109



Save the file to the Firmware folder you created earlier.

### Step 110

The naming convention for firmware files is as follows:

- **SCCP firmware:** P003xxyyzzww.bin: where x represents the major version, y represents the major subversion, z represents the maintenance version, and w represents the maintenance subversion.
    
- **SIP firmware:** P0S3-xx-y-zz: where x represents the major version, y represents the minor version, and z represents the subversions.
    
- **MGCP firmware:** P0M3-xx-y-zz: where M is the third character. The major, minor, and subversions for MGCP are consistent with the SIP naming convention.
    
- For Java-based IP phones, the following naming conventions are used for image files:
    
    1. **SCCP firmware:** TERMnn.xx-y-z-ww or SCCPnn.xx-y-zz-ww: where n represents the phone type, x represents the major version, y represents the major subversion, z represents the maintenance version, and w represents the maintenance subversion.
        

Based on this information, the file you will be using (78xx.12-1-1-12) will upgrade 7800 series IP phones to major version 12, major subversion 1, maintenance version 1, and maintenance subversion 12.

## Install the device package to Cisco Unified Communications Manager

### Step 111

Navigate to Cisco Unified OS Administration (**https://10.1.5.5/cmplatform**) and log in with username (**Administrator**) and password (**C0ll@B**).

### Step 112



Select **Software Upgrades > Install/Upgrade**. Use the following information to complete the software location form:

- Source: **Remote Filesystem**
    
- Directory: **/**
    
- Server: **10.1.5.200**
    
- Username: **Administrator**
    
- Password: **C0ll@B**
    
- Transfer Protocol: **SFTP**
    

### Step 113



Click **Next** and confirm that the file you created in the Firmware folder on PC-1 shows in the Options/Upgrade drop-down. Click **Next**.

### Step 114



Click **Next** on the File Checksum Details page. After a minute or two, you will see the Installation Status change to Complete.

### Step 115

From the **Navigation** drop-down at the top right part of the page, select **Cisco Unified CM Administration**, and click **Go**. Log in to Cisco Unified CM Administration using username (**Administrator**) and password (**C0ll@B**). Select **Device > Device Settings > Device Defaults**. Verify that the new Load Information is reflected for the Cisco 7811, 7821, 7841, and 7861 phone models.

### Step 116

From the **Navigation** drop-down at the top right part of the page, select **Cisco Unified Serviceability**, and click **Go**. Select **Tools > Control Center – Feature Services**. Select the Cisco Unified Communications Manager publisher from the drop-down list, then **restart the Cisco TFTP Service**. The restart is essential for new software installs to be made available to endpoint devices.

At this point, any 7811,7821, 7841, or 7861 phones with a lower version of the software would be upgraded the next time the phone is restarted. You can force this to happen by restarting the phones from Cisco Unified Communications Manager. It is recommended that you restart the phones out of hours as phones will not be able to make or receive calls while the phone's firmware is being upgraded. Phones that are reset during an active call will remain active until the phone is hung up. The phone will reset immediately after being hung up.
