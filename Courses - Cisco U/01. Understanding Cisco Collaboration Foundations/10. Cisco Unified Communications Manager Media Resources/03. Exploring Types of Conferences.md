There are several different ways to use conferencing resources. The available options will vary depending on the conferencing resources installed in your collaboration environment.

There are two ways to become a member of a conference. You can request a conferencing resource at the moment you need it or you can use a predefined conferencing resource.

Different systems use a variety of names for these functions.

## Instant Conferences

An instant audio or video conference (also referred to as an ad hoc conference) is an impromptu conference. Instant conferences are not scheduled or arranged prior to the conference. For example, a point-to-point call that is escalated to a multipoint conference is considered to be an instant conference.

![[Pasted image 20241114190025.png]]

An instant or ad hoc conference starts with two people already talking. They want to add others to the conversation.

![[Pasted image 20241114190038.png]]

In this example, the user at directory number 1001 presses the Conference key on the phone, Jabber client, or video endpoint.

![[Pasted image 20241114190049.png]]

Cisco Unified Communications Manager stops the original media stream. 1001 is instructed to play a dial tone and Cisco Unified Communications Manager creates a one-way audio stream from the MOH server to 1002. The user at 1001 dials the number of the third participant in the call (1003).

![[Pasted image 20241114190307.png]]



Cisco Unified Communications Manager locates the number in its dial plan and signals 1003 about the incoming call. 1003 answers the phone and Cisco Unified Communications Manager creates a media stream between the devices. The originator (1001) presses the conference button again.

![[Pasted image 20241114190057.png]]



Cisco Unified Communications Manager determines which conferencing resource to use for the call using the Media Resource Group List (MRGL) of 1001. Cisco Unified CM stops the media streams between 1001 and 1003. New media streams are created from the phones to the conferencing resource, which in this example is the software conferencing bridge in Cisco Unified CM. All the people are now connected to the conferencing bridge. More people can be added to the call by repeating the steps.

## Permanent Conferences

Permanent conferences (also referred to as Meet-Me, static, or rendezvous conferences) are predefined addresses that allow conferencing without previous scheduling. The conference host shares the address with other users who can call in to that address at any time.

Permanent conference resources are used on a first-come, first-served basis (referred to as "nonassured"). For a guaranteed conference resource (assured), scheduled conferences should be used.

This type of conferencing is called Meet-Me in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. An enhanced version with audio prompts is called Conference Now.

Cisco Webex allows you to have a personal room that can always be accessed with the same URL. Cisco Meeting Server has a similar feature called Personal Space.

The following sequence shows the call flow for a Meet-Me conference on Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Meet-Me is different from a regular conference because the bridge is enabled as soon as the first person activates the session.

![[Pasted image 20241114190119.png]]

In this example, the user at 1001 wants to start the conference. Meet-Me must be started by an internal user. Once the bridge is open, anyone that dials the access number can join the call. 1001 goes off-hook, presses the Meet-Me softkey and dials a valid preconfigured Meet-Me code (1999).

![[Pasted image 20241114190340.png]]


Cisco Unified Communications Manager checks the MRGL to find a conference bridge. In this example, the IOS conference bridge is selected. Cisco Unified Communications Manager sends media stream setup messages to the bridge and the phone. The bridge is now open for others to join.

![[Pasted image 20241114190352.png]]

1002 goes off-hook and dials 1999. Cisco Unified Communications Manager matches the call to the active Meet-Me conference. Cisco Unified Communications Manager sends setup messages to the phone and the bridge to create the media streams.

![[Pasted image 20241114190403.png]]

Additional callers can connect to the conference in the same way. The number of participants is limited by settings in Cisco Unified Communications Manager service parameters and the capacity of the conference bridge.

This type of conferencing is also possible using Cisco Meeting Server and Cisco Unified Communications Manager-based software conferencing.

Conference Now is an enhancement to Meet-Me conferencing. The Cisco Unified Communications Manager-based feature includes an interactive voice response (IVR) that plays prompts to assist the callers in selecting the correct conference session. Session passwords can also be assigned with this enhancement.

## Scheduled Conferences

A scheduled conference is started by its initiator through a scheduling management system called Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (Cisco TMS). Conferences are booked via Cisco TMS with a start and end time and, optionally, with a predefined set of participants.

While instant and permanent conferences are native to Cisco Unified Communications Manager, scheduled conferences require additional applications. Cisco Meeting Server or older TelePresence Multipoint Control Units (MCUs) such as TelePresence Server or the Cisco TelePresence MCU 4500 Series.

The following example shows the call flow of a scheduled conference using Cisco Meeting Server and the Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (Cisco TMS).

The process begins with a user or administrator creating the conference in the Cisco TMS. Parameters such as the number of participants, date and time of the conference, occurrence rates, and conference master are configured. A conference can become active automatically for all participants or the conference can block users until the conference owner joins the session.

![[Pasted image 20241114190413.png]]

In this example, the site requests a recurring conference every Tuesday at 09:00. At 09:00 on Tuesday, TMS communicates with Cisco Meeting Server using APIs to create the conference.

![[Pasted image 20241114190420.png]]

A Jabber user knows about the conference due to an earlier email. They enter the supplied URI into the Jabber client and press Enter. Cisco Unified Communications Manager matches the URI to a SIP route pattern, which points to the SIP trunk that connects to Cisco Meeting Server.

![[Pasted image 20241114190428.png]]

Cisco Unified Communications Manager sends a SIP INVITE message to Cisco Meeting Server and negotiates the media stream between Jabber and Cisco Meeting Server. The first user is on the conference.

![[Pasted image 20241114190442.png]]

Additional devices follow the same steps to join the conference. The users can use the URI in Jabber or a web browser or dial a phone number on a phone.

![[Pasted image 20241114190449.png]]

In this example, the call was supposed to last one hour. After the hour has elapsed, TMS sends API messages to remove the conferencing session from Cisco Meeting Server.

## Cascading Conferences

Larger organizations sometimes need a large conference but there are not enough ports available on a single MCU. In these cases, it is possible to connect one MCU to another in order to create larger conferences. This technique is called "cascading" and involves dialing from one MCU conference to another MCU conference. Each MCU is seen as an additional participant on the local MCU conference. This technique limits the experience available to participants because they can only see a proportion of the participants on one or another MCU. The cascade occurs between a single primary (master) MCU and one or more secondary (slave) MCUs. Endpoints can be connected to either the primary or secondary MCUs. These connections use up a port on each secondary MCU and one port per secondary MCU on the primary MCU.

![[Pasted image 20241114190457.png]]

Cascading conferences are used with older types of conferencing devices such as Cisco MCU and Cisco TelePresence Server. Cisco Meeting Server has the ability to manage bandwidth using multiple servers in a geographically spread cluster without the need to cascade.

During a cascaded conference, the video from the active speaker on a secondary MCU is sent to the primary MCU. On the primary MCU, the video from all secondary MCUs and the directly attached endpoints are mixed in accordance with the conference layout. This view is then sent back to each secondary MCU, which then forwards this to its endpoints. Each of these endpoints receives a separately encoded copy of the stream based on their capabilities.

Geographic cascading is a way of reducing WAN bandwidth by using the Conductor to generate cascade links between conference bridges in different regions. The intent is that users join conferences in their home region. This limits the use of WAN bandwidth between regions because there is only one video stream between the different regions.

Geographic cascading involves choosing one region to host the primary conference, which is the conference that all other secondary conferences generate cascade links into. The participants in the primary and secondary conferences have different conference experiences.

Geographic cascading involves many elements of the video network operating in tight coordination. It requires a strong knowledge of the technologies involved and considerable amount of forward planning. As a result, if you are intending to implement forms of geographic cascading, it is recommended that you enlist the help of the Cisco Advanced Services or Customer Experience (CX) to aid in planning and execution of the necessary configuration.

## User Experience in Cascaded Conferences

The video stream sent from the secondary conference bridge to the primary conference bridge is the active speaker on the secondary conference. This allows the active speaker on a secondary conference bridge to be seen in the primary conference in the same way in which other participants would be seen.

The video stream from the primary conference contains the conference layout that is used on the primary conference bridge. If no layout is specified on the primary conference bridge, then it defaults to a full-screen view of the active speaker. The video stream from the primary conference bridge is shown full-screen to all participants on the secondary conference. This can result in an active speaker on the secondary conference bridge seeing themselves.

## In Which Situations Should Geographic Cascading Be Used?

The generation of cascade links involves the use of one additional port on the primary and secondary conference bridge, respectively. This along with the participant layouts in cascaded conferences makes the use of geographic cascading unsuited to small conferences. It is recommended that geographic cascades are used for large conferences.

Geographic cascading involves the designation of a certain conference to be the primary conference, which is the conference into which all other conferences dial.

## Video Layouts

Video systems have the ability to change the way that users see the other participants in a video conference. This view is called the video layout.

Each video conferencing system has a range of different views that can be set as the default view or made available as optional views for users.

The end user can select their desired video layout from the options menu of the device or client that they are using to connect to the video call.

The following are the possible choices in the Cisco Meeting Server.

![[Pasted image 20241114190509.png]]

- **Automatic (Auto):** Participants will be shown in large panes when they become the active speaker. Recent active speakers will be shown in large panes, with other participants shown in a "dock" of smaller picture-in-picture (PiP) panes at the base of the screen. The maximum number of participants that will be visible are the four loudest speakers plus a maximum eight participants in the dock (total 12 participants).

- **All Equal:** The layout expands from a 4-person (2 x 2) view up to a 25-person (5 x 5) view, with all participants shown at an equal size.
- **Stacked:** This layout shows a maximum of 6 PiPs below the main speaker, even if there are more than 7 other callers in the meeting. The PiPs are separate from the main speaker pane.    
    1. If there is only one other video stream to be shown, then it will be shown full screen, "point-to-point" mode.
- **TelePresence:** This layout shows a maximum of 6 PiPs below the main speaker, even if there are more than 7 other callers in the meeting. The PiPs are overlaid at the bottom of the main speaker pane.
    1. If there is only one other video stream to be shown, then it will be shown full screen, "point-to-point" mode.
- **Speaker Only:** Only the single loudest speaker is visible.
- **One Plus N:** Automatically changes the screen layout on SIP endpoints as participants join or leave a meeting. For example, one plus 5, one plus 7, one plus 9.
    - If there is only one other video stream to be shown, then it will be shown full screen, "point-to-point" mode.
