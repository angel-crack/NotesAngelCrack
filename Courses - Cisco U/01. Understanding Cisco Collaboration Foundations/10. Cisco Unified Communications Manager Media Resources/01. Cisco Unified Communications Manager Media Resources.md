Media-processing functions include mixing multiple streams to create one output stream (as in conferencing), passing the stream from one connection to another (using Media Termination Point [MTP]), converting the data stream from one compression type to another (as in transcoding), echo cancellation, signaling, terminating a voice stream from a time-division multiplexing (TDM) circuit (coding and decoding), packetizing a stream, and streaming announcements.

A media resource is a software- or hardware-based entity that performs media-processing functions on the media streams to which it is connected.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager provides some media functions through the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application service. This service can run on any server in a Unified Communications Manager cluster and is enabled by activating the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming App feature service in Cisco Unified Serviceability.

In addition, hardware-based media resources, such as digital signal processor (DSP) modules in Cisco IOS and IOS XE routers, can be used.

## Cisco Unified Communications Manager Media Resource Functions

|Media Resource|Function|
|---|---|
|Rich Media Conference Bridge|A conference bridge joins multiple participants into a single call. The bridge mixes the streams and creates a unique output stream for each connected party.|
|Transcoder|A transcoder converts an input stream that uses one codec into an output stream that uses a different codec.|
|MTP|An MTP bridges the media streams and allows them to be set up and torn down independently.|
|Annunciator|An annunciator streams spoken messages and various call-progress tones.|

|Media Resource|Function|
|---|---|
|VOH|The video-on-hold feature is for video contact centers where customers that place a call are able to watch a specific video after initial consultation with the contact center agent.|
|TRP|A trusted relay point is a device that can be inserted into a media stream to act as a control point for that stream.|

This list describes the Cisco Unified Communications Manager media resources and their functions:

- **Rich media conference bridge:** This resource joins multiple participants into a single call. The resource can accept any number of connections for a given conference, up to the maximum number of streams that is allowed for a single conference on that device. Each participant that joins a conference provides its own media stream to the conferencing resource. The conference bridge mixes the streams of the participants and creates an output stream for each connected party. The output stream for any party is the composite of the streams from all connected parties, minus the input stream of the given party. Some conference bridges mix only the three loudest talkers on the conference and distribute that composite stream to each participant, minus the input stream of the participant if the participant is one of the three talkers.
- **Transcoder (xcoder):** This resource takes the stream of one codec and converts it from one compression type to another. For example, the resource could take a stream from a G.711 codec and transcode it in real time to a G.729 stream. In addition, a transcoder provides MTP capabilities and can be used to provide dual tone multifrequency compatibility (DTMF relay) and support for outbound SIP early offer, when required. Two streams that use the same codec but different sampling rates can also be connected. A single-site deployment usually has no need for transcoding devices.
- **Media Termination Point (MTP):** This resource accepts two full-duplex G.711 streams. The resource bridges the media streams and allows them to be set up and torn down independently. The streaming data that is received from the input stream on one connection is passed to the output stream on the other connection, and vice versa. MTPs can also provide DTMF conversion, provide support for early offer on SIP trunks, and allow supplementary services on older H.323v1 devices.
- **Annunciator (ANN):** This software function of the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application provides the ability to stream spoken messages or various call-progress tones from the system to a user. The annunciator can send multiple one-way Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams to devices such as Cisco IP phones or gateways. The announcements can be customized by replacing the appropriate .wav file.
- **Music on hold (MOH):** This integral feature of Cisco Unified Communications Manager provides music to callers when a call is placed on hold, transferred, parked, or added to an ad hoc conference.
- **Trusted relay point (TRP):** A trusted relay point is a device that can be inserted into a media stream to act as a control point for that stream. It may be used to provide further processing on that stream or as a method to ensure that the stream follows a specific desired path. This function can be used to make sure that all endpoints use a specific device as a network waypoint. This device could be a specific firewall or other security device that secures a connection between two sites in the enterprise network.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager offers software-based media resources. The Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application feature service provides these media resources:

- Audio conference bridge (G.711 only)
- MTP
- Annunciator
- MOH

These media resources cannot be provided by Cisco Unified Communications Manager and require dedicated hardware or software products:

- Audio conferencing (G.711 to any codec or any codec to any codec)
    
- Video conference bridge
    
- Transcoder
    
- VOH
    
- TRP
    

## Media Streams with Media Resources

Signaling between external router-based (hardware) media resources and Cisco Unified Communications Manager usually uses Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP). Cisco Meeting Server or Cisco Expressway usually use SIP signaling.

![[Pasted image 20241114081133.png]]

All media streams from any endpoint are always terminated by the media resources that are involved in the call flow. Some resources such as the annunciator or MOH act as one end of the media streams.

MTPs, transcoders, conference bridges, and most other media resources split the media stream into two legs: the first leg is between one endpoint and the media resource, and the second leg is between the media resource and another endpoint.

## Audio Conferencing

An audio conference bridge joins multiple participants into a single call. A software conference bridge can run on one or more Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers in a cluster.

![[Pasted image 20241114081144.png]]

Audio streams exist between IP phones, gateways, and the conference bridge.

Signaling messages are exchanged between IP phones and Cisco Unified Communications Manager, between conference bridges and Cisco Unified Communications Manager, and between gateways and Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

Some audio conference bridges that are controlled by Cisco Unified Communications Manager use SCCP to communicate with Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Cisco Unified Communications Manager does not distinguish between software- and hardware-based audio conference bridges when it processes a conference-allocation request.

Software conferencing uses the IP Voice Media Streaming Application. Hardware conferencing can be configured in digital signal processor (DSP) resources on an Integrated Services Router or use the resources of Cisco Meeting Server. If a customer has older Multipoint Control units such as the Cisco TelePresence 5300 Series, the customer could integrate those devices with Cisco Unified Communications Manager using Cisco TelePresence Conductor as an intermediary.

The number of individual conferences and the maximum number of participants per conference that the resource can support varies, depending on the resource.

## Video Conferencing

A video conference bridge joins multiple participants into a single video call. Video conferencing resources are hardware or software types. The Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application service does not support video conferences.

![[Pasted image 20241114081218.png]]

The recommended deployment of video conferencing is with the Cisco Meeting Server. Older products such as Cisco multipoint control units and Cisco TelePresence Server are end of life but can be integrated with Cisco Unified Communications Manager to support video conferencing.

Media streams exist between each conference participant and the conference bridge.

Signaling messages are exchanged between conference participants and Cisco Unified Communications Manager and between the video conference bridge and Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Cisco Meeting Server uses SIP to communicate with Cisco Unified Communications Manager. The packet voice DSP module, generations 3 and 4 (with Cisco IOS Software Release 15.1.4M and later releases), use SCCP to communicate with Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

The number of individual video conferences, the maximum number of participants per conference, and the type of conference that the resource can support varies, depending on the resource.

Each video conferencing device supports different codecs and screen layouts.

## Transcoders

A transcoder converts an input audio stream that uses one codec into an output stream that uses a different codec.

![[Pasted image 20241114081228.png]]


The transcoder in the figure is implemented by using the Cisco IOS router DSP resources. The example shows an application server, such as a voicemail server that supports only G.711 codecs, and an endpoint that requires the G.729 codec to save bandwidth.

Transcoders can also provide Media Termination Point functionality, but the transcoder uses more DSP resources to accomplish the function than software MTPs, which do not require DSPs to function.

Audio streams exist from the IP phones to the transcoder and from the application server to the transcoder.

Signaling messages are exchanged between IP phones and Cisco Unified Communications Manager, between a transcoder and Cisco Unified Communications Manager, and between an application server and Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

## Media Termination Points

An MTP bridges two media streams and allows them to be set up and torn down independently.

![[Pasted image 20241114081240.png]]

Certain MTP resources can be used as an instance of translation between incompatible G.711 audio streams or change packetization rates such as G.711 mu-law at 33 packets per second to G.711 mu-law at 50 packets per second. MTPs can be used to synchronize clocking or to enable certain H.323 devices for supplementary services.

MTPs can also be used to convert DTMF transmission methods between endpoints such as SIP-KPML to RTP-NTE between a Cisco IP phone and an Internet telephony service provider.

Another MTP function is to allow outbound SIP early offer when the IP address and port number of the final source device is not yet known. Cisco Unified Communications Manager will activate an MTP and use its IP address and port number to start the signaling.

Audio streams exist between IP phones and an MTP.

Signaling messages are exchanged between IP phones and Cisco Unified Communications Manager, and between an MTP and Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

## Annunciators

![[Pasted image 20241114081250.png]]

The annunciator uses the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application service, and allows Cisco Unified Communications Manager to play prerecorded announcements (.wav files) and tones to Cisco Unified IP phones, gateways, and other configurable devices. The annunciator works with Cisco Unified Communications Manager Multilevel Precedence and Preemption, which enables Cisco Unified Communications Manager to alert callers as to why the call fails. The annunciator can also play tones for some transferred calls and conferences where required.

## Music on Hold

MOH is an integrated feature of Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers as part of the IP Voice Media Streaming Application.

![[Pasted image 20241114081258.png]]

This feature provides music to callers when a call is placed on hold, transferred, parked, or added to an ad hoc conference. Implementing MOH is simple when using the default unicast method. Using multicast MOH requires more in-depth knowledge of multicast traffic in a data network, MOH call flows, configuration options, and server behavior and requirements.

The integrated MOH feature allows users to place on-net and off-net users on hold with music that is streamed from a streaming source. The MOH feature allows two types of holds:

- End-user hold
    
- Network hold, which includes transfer hold, conference hold, and call park hold
    

Audio streams exist between IP phones and the MOH server and between the gateway and the MOH server.

Signaling messages are exchanged between IP phones and Cisco Unified Communications Manager, between the MOH server and Cisco Unified Communications Manager, and between the gateway and Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
