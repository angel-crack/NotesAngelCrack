Cisco Unified Communications Manager supports several conferencing devices. Some devices support only audio conferences, while others support audio and video conferences. This content provides an overview of conferencing devices that Cisco Unified Communications Manager supports and a comparison of their features.

One major distinction between the different conferencing devices is whether they support audio only or audio and video. Audio only conferencing resources are provided by the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application as a software conference bridge, or Cisco IOS and IOS XE routers with digital signal processors configured as a conference bridge.

Audio and video are supported on the Cisco Meeting Server. Cisco Meeting Server can handle audio only, video only, and combined audio and video conferences.

There are also older multimedia conferencing bridges, such as the Cisco TelePresence MCU 4500 or 5300 Series. These devices are no longer sold by Cisco, but existing devices can be integrated directly with Cisco Unified Communications Manager via a Cisco TelePresence Conductor, or using a Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server.

## Software Conference Bridge

Cisco Unified Communications Manager has a built-in, software-based audio conference bridge that is part of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager IP Voice Media Streaming Application service.

![[Pasted image 20241114081909.png]]

The Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application is a resource that provides several functions, including the audio conference bridge, MTP, annunciator, and MOH. You can activate the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application service on any of the servers within a cluster. On each server on which you activate the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application service, you can selectively enable each function that is provided by the service.

A software conference bridge is automatically added for each server in a cluster that enables the IP Voice Media Streaming Application. If the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application service is not activated or if the software conference bridge media resource is disabled, the software conference bridge media resource is not operational.

Each software conference bridge registers with one or more Cisco Unified Communications Manager call-processing servers (these servers have the Cisco CallManager service activated) based on the Cisco Unified Communications Manager group of the device pool that is applied to the software conference bridge. By default, the software conference bridge is a member of the Default device pool.

Any combination of wideband or G.711 a-law and mu-law streams can be connected to the same conference. The number of conferences that can be supported on a given configuration depends on the server on which the conference bridge software is running and on the other functionality that has been enabled at the server.

The table shows the minimum, the maximum, and the default number of participants for ad hoc and Meet-Me audio conferences.

|Conference Type|Minimum Participants|Maximum Participants|Default Max Participants|
|---|---|---|---|
|Ad Hoc|3|256|4|
|Meet-Me or Conference Now|1|256|4|

## Note

When more than 48 participants are needed for conferencing, a software conference bridge should be deployed on a dedicated Cisco Unified Communications Manager server where the Cisco CallManager service is _no_t activated.

This type of conference bridge is a simplified implementation. It does not identify parties that are silent and uses a simple summing algorithm, which may cause audio quality and low volume levels for the conference when there are many participants.

## Cisco IOS and IOS XE Conference Bridge

Digital signal processors that are configured through Cisco IOS as conference resources load firmware into the DSPs that are specific to conferencing functionality only, and these DSPs cannot be used for any other media feature.

![[Pasted image 20241114081921.png]]

DSPs on PVDM hardware are configured individually as voice termination, conferencing, media termination, or transcoding, so that DSPs on a single PVDM can be used as different resource types. Allocate DSPs to voice termination first, then to other functionality as needed. The DSP resources for a conference are reserved during configuration, based on the profile attributes. The resources reserved assume that the maximum number of participants will always join.

Hardware audio conference bridges offer a wider range of capabilities and codec format support than the software conference bridges. Cisco recommends using hardware audio conference bridges where the enterprise requires a more versatile audio conference bridge, and codec support for higher-complexity codecs such as G.729 to take advantage of bandwidth savings.

Cisco Integrated Services Routers use PVDMs to provide conferencing and other services. The modules contain multiple DSP chips. Each DSP chip supports a conference. Newer generations such as the PVDM4 support more participants per conference than older versions.

Cisco Integrated Services Routers have provided audio conferencing to Cisco Unified Communications Manager for a long time:

- ISR 2900 and 3900 Series routers use PVDM3 DSPs, which can support multiple conferences with up to 16 participants in each conference. PVDM3 modules are available in 16, 32, 64, 128, 192, and 256 stream modules.
    
- The newest ISR routers come equipped with PVDM4 modules. Previous router models support up to 2 DSP modules on the motherboard. A 4000 Series router only has one PVDM slot on the motherboard, but additional modules can be installed on digital trunk interface cards. For greater DSP capacity, high capacity enhanced services modules can be installed in dedicated slots on the ISR 4000 Series. Modules are available in 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 stream capacities.
    

While it was possible to determine simple DSP-based capacity calculations with PVDM2 and 3, the conferencing capacity of PVDM4 modules is dependent on multiple factors. The only reliable method for calculating the number and size of conference sessions is to use the DSP calculator at [http://www.cisco.com](http://www.cisco.com/).

Cisco IOS and IOS XE conference bridges are audio-only but the device supports multiple codecs. The DSPs have the greatest capacity using the G.711 codec. If you want to use codecs other than g.711, the overall capacity of the DSP module is reduced.

When using a Cisco IOS or IOS XE router as a conference bridge, you need to install the DSP resources, configure a conferencing profile in the router, and create an enhanced IOS conference bridge in Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

## Cisco Meeting Server

Beyond the internal software and the Cisco IOS-based bridges, options such as Cisco Meeting Server expand the conferencing capabilities of a collaboration deployment.

![[Pasted image 20241114081930.png]]

Cisco Meeting Server is a software-based audio and video conference bridge. Cisco Meeting Server can start as a single server supporting up to 96 high- definition video connections and higher numbers if standard-definition video or audio is the connection method. The Meeting Server cluster can expand to 24 servers that can handle 12,000 concurrent high-definition calls that can connect at 40 callers per second.

Cisco Meeting Server allows users to connect from phones, PCs, video endpoints, and mobile phones.

Cisco Meeting Server uses SIP signaling to connect to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Cisco Unified Communications Manager uses a SIP trunk to send calls to the Cisco Meeting Server when connecting to a scheduled or rendezvous conference. The Cisco Meeting Server is configured as a conference bridge in Cisco Unified Communications Manager for ad hoc conference calls.
