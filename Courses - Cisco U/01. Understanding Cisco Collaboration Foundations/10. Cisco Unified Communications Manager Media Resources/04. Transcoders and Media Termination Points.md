Transcoders and Media Termination Points (MTPs) share several characteristics. Both act as relay points for media streams and can modify the media stream if necessary. Transcoders and MTPs provide functions that allow devices with differing capabilities to communicate. These differences could be incompatible codecs, packetization rates, or dual tone multifrequency (DTMF) sending capabilities.

## Transcoders

![[Pasted image 20241114190813.png]]

A transcoder is a device that converts an input stream from one codec into an output stream that uses a different codec. Starting with Cisco IOS Release 15.0.1M, a transcoder also supports transrating, whereby it connects two streams that utilize the same codec but with a different packet size.

Transcoding from G.711 to any other codec is referred to as **traditional transcoding**. Transcoding between any two non-G.711 codecs is called **universal transcoding** and requires Universal Cisco IOS transcoders. Universal transcoding is supported starting with Cisco IOS Release 12.4.20T. Universal transcoding has a lower DSP density than traditional transcoding.

## Codec Selection in Cisco Unified Communications Manager

![[Pasted image 20241114190840.png]]

When communicating between two devices controlled by Cisco Unified Communications Manager, regions determines the maximum amount of bandwidth that will be used for the call. The default maximum bandwidth is 64K. This means that the two end points can use any codec that uses less that 64K as the payload portion of the audio stream. With this setting, Cisco IP phones prefer Opus and G.722 but can also support G.711, iLBC, G.729 variants, and other codecs. The supported codecs will vary by phone manufacturer and model and the preference list itself can be modified.

## Note

The Opus codec is supported for SIP calls only. Opus is a variable rate codec and sends a max variable bit rate in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) message, which Cisco Unified Communications Manager can adjust in the answer to the maximum set in the region configuration.

Since collaboration involves both audio and video endpoints, regions contain maximum bandwidth settings for audio, desktop video, and immersive (TelePresence) video.

The example in the figure above shows a simple region configuration. The company has 2 sites. Each site will use 64K internally since bandwidth is not a concern, and 8K (G.729) between sites to conserve bandwidth. The company is using a third-party voicemail system that does not support G.729. This causes a problem when callers from the BR site want to communicate with the voicemail server.

There are two options for this scenario. The first option is that regions could be configured to allow 64K across the WAN for calls to voicemail and 8K to all other HQ devices. The second possibility would be to add a transcoder at the HQ location. The transcoder is placed locally to the device that needs the codec conversion. In this example, the audio stream should traverse the WAN at G.729 and convert at the HQ site to G.711, since there is no bandwidth restriction inside the HQ environment. This design protects the bandwidth of the WAN and allows the BR phones to be compatible with the voicemail system.

Regions are configured to implement the desired behavior. Three regions are needed to make this work. The Default region can be renamed as HQ_rg and two new regions, named BR_rg and VoiceMail_rg, are added to the system. The maximum bandwidth settings between the regions are configured to match the following table:

|Source|Destination|Max Bandwidth|
|---|---|---|
|HQ_rg|BR_rg|8K|
|VoiceMail_rg|BR_rg|64K|
|VoiceMail_rg|HQ_rg|64K|
|All others|All others|64K|

Each site and voicemail would need, at least, one device pool with the correct region assignment. The device pool is assigned to the phones, gateways, and trunks at each physical location. The VoiceMail device pool is assigned to the voicemail trunk or ports.

A Cisco IOS transcoder needs to be added to the HQ router and Cisco Unified Communications Manager is configured to allow the transcoder to register.

The transcoder is assigned to a Media Resource Group (MRG), which is assigned to a Media Resource Group List (MRGL). This MRGL will be assigned to either the device pool of VoiceMail (preferred) or the voicemail trunk or ports.

## Note

Regions control bandwidth and codec choices on a per-call basis but do not control the total bandwidth between two sites. Locations can be used to control total bandwidth between two sites. Locations are outside the scope of this course.

## IOS Router Codec Selection

![[Pasted image 20241114190900.png]]

While Cisco Unified Communications Manager controlled devices rely on region settings to determine the codec, Cisco IOS devices acting as gateways and Cisco Unified Border Element use a different mechanism. In both H.323 or SIP, the codec is negotiated between Cisco Unified Communications Manager and the Cisco IOS router.

The region setting for the SIP trunk or the H.323 gateway controls the codecs that are offered by Cisco Unified Communications Manager to the router. Setting regions to 64K will allow Cisco Unified Communications Manager to negotiate G.722, G.711, iLBC, and G.729. If the regions setting is 8K, Cisco Unified Communications Manager can only negotiate with G.729 since this is the only codec that creates an 8K or smaller media stream.

The matched inbound or outbound dial peer determines the codec for the router. If the dial peer is set to a specific codec, as in the example’s BR router, then that call setup can only negotiate to G.711. The default codec of a VOIP dial peer is G.729r8.

Since the gateway function of the router is also configured in Cisco Unified Communications Manager, it is possible to configure regions to allow only 8K between the gateway and HQ. This means that Cisco Unified Communications Manager will offer G.729 but the router will only allow G.711. The call would fail without a transcoder.

A more flexible method is to use an ordered list of codecs in the router. This list, called "voice class codec," can be assigned to a VOIP dial peer to allow the router to negotiate a range of codecs. In the example, the HQ router has a voice class codec 1 list that contains G.711u-law as the first choice and G.729r8 as the second choice.

This allows the router the flexibility to use G.711u-law when possible but drop to G.729r8 when requested. The voice class codec is assigned to the VOIP dial peers that require the flexibility.

## Transcoder Recommendations

In a Unified Communications Manager system, the typical use of a transcoder is to convert between a G.711 voice stream and the low bit rate, compressed voice stream, G.729a. The following cases determine when transcoder resources are needed:

- Single codec for the entire system
    
    A single codec is generally used in a single-site deployment that usually has no need for conserving bandwidth. When a single codec is configured for all calls in the system, then no transcoder resources are required. In this scenario, G.711 is the most common choice that is supported by all vendors.
    
- Multiple codecs in use in the system, with all endpoints capable of all codec types
    
    The most common reason for multiple codecs is to use G.711 for LAN calls to maximize the call quality, and to use a low-bandwidth codec to maximize bandwidth efficiency for calls that traverse a WAN with limited bandwidth. Cisco recommends using G.729a as the low-bandwidth codec because it is supported on all Cisco Unified IP phone models as well as most other Cisco Unified Communications devices, therefore it can eliminate the need for transcoding.
    
    Although Unified Communications Manager allows configuration of other low-bandwidth codecs between regions, some phone models do not support those codecs and therefore would require transcoders. The use of transcoders is avoided if all devices support and are configured for both G.711 and G.729, because the devices will use the appropriate codec on a call-by-call basis.
    
- Multiple codecs in use in the system and some endpoints support or are configured for G.711 only.
    
    This condition exists when G.729a is used in the system but there are devices that do not support this codec, or a device with G.729a support may be configured to not use it. In this case, a transcoder is also required. Devices from some third-party vendors may not support G.729.
    
    One important factor is that transcoders are always hardware. Software transcoding does exist in some applications such as Cisco Unity Connection but it is very CPU intensive. Transcoding services are provided by DSP modules in Cisco IOS routers. Since the cost of the transcoding resource can be a factor, careful design with regions and codec lists in the routers can minimize the need for transcoders.
    
    A transcoder is also capable of performing the same functionality as a Media Termination Point (MTP). In cases where transcoder functionality and MTP functionality are both needed, a transcoder is allocated by the system. If MTP functionality is required, Unified Communications Manager will allocate either a transcoder or an MTP from the resource pool, and the choice of resource will be determined by the MRGs.
    
    To finalize the design, it is necessary to know how many transcoders are needed and where they will be placed. For a multisite deployment, Cisco recommends placing a transcoder local at each site where it might be required. If multiple codecs are needed, it is necessary to know how many endpoints do not support all codecs, where those endpoints are located, what other groups will be accessing those resources, how many maximum simultaneous calls these devices must support, and where those resources are located in the network.
    

## Media Termination Points

![[Pasted image 20241114190915.png]]

An MTP is an entity that accepts two full-duplex media streams. It bridges the streams together and allows them to be set up and torn down independently. The streaming data received from the input stream on one connection is passed to the output stream on the other connection, and vice versa. MTPs have many possible uses, such as repacketization of an audio stream and DTMF conversion. Other functions of MTPs include calls over SIP trunks, H.323 supplementary services, and H.323 Outbound Fast Connect.

## MTP Resources

The following types of devices are available for use as an MTP:

- Software MTP (Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application)
    
    A software MTP is a device that is implemented by enabling the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application on a Unified Communications Manager server. When the installed application is configured as an MTP application, it registers with a Unified Communications Manager node and informs Unified Communications Manager of how many MTP resources it supports.
    
    A software MTP device supports only G.711 or pass-through codec. The IP Voice Media Streaming Application is a resource that may also be used for other functions such as MOH or software conferencing. The total load on the server must be considered when planning MTPs.
    
- Software MTP (Based on Cisco IOS)
    
    This MTP allows configuration of any of the following codecs, but only one may be configured at a given time: G.711 mu-law and a-law, G.729a, G.729, G.729ab, G.729b, and pass-through. Some of these are not pertinent to a Unified Communications Manager implementation.
    
    Router configurations permit up to 1000 individual streams, which support 500 transrated sessions. This number of G.711 streams generates 10 MB of traffic. The Cisco ISR G2s and ASR routers can support significantly higher numbers than this.
    
- Hardware MTP
    
    DSP resources located on the voice modules, service modules, or on the on-board Cisco Packet Voice/Fax Digital Signal Processor (PVDM2, PVDM3, or PVDM4) slots for Cisco Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) can also be used as an MTP resource.
    
    ## Note
    
    When Cisco IOS MTP resources are invoked by Unified Communications Manager for a call flow, a software session rather than a hardware DSP session is consumed unless the media legs of the call flow require transrating. Thus, for flows invoking an MTP, a DSP session is used only when transrating (conversion between media legs with the same codec but different packetization times) is required.
    

## Media Termination Point Functions
![[Pasted image 20241114190928.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241114190939.png]]
## Repacketization of a Stream

A Cisco Unified Communications Manager software MTP can be used to transcode G.711 a-law audio packets to G.711 mu-law packets and vice versa. Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Cisco IOS hardware MTPs can be used to bridge two connections that use different packetization periods (different sample sizes).

## DTMF Conversion

DTMF tones are used during a call to signal to a far-end device for purposes of navigating a menu system, entering data, or other manipulation. They are processed differently than DTMF tones sent during a call setup as part of the call control. There are several methods for sending DTMF over IP, and two communicating endpoints might not support a common procedure. In these cases, Unified Communications Manager may dynamically insert an MTP in the media path to convert DTMF signals from one endpoint to the other. Unfortunately, this method does not scale because one MTP resource is required for each such call. The following sections help determine the optimum amount of MTP resources required, based on the combination of endpoints, trunks, and gateways in the system.

If Unified Communications Manager determines that an MTP needs to be inserted but no MTP resources are available, it uses the setting of the service parameter, **Fail call if MTP allocation fails**, to decide whether or not to allow the call to proceed. This service parameter is set to a default value of False. With this default configuration, an incoming call on a SIP early offer trunk would result in an outbound delayed offer.

## Call over SIP Trunks

SIP trunk configuration is used to set up communication with a SIP User Agent such as another Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster or a SIP gateway.

SIP negotiates media exchange via Session Description Protocol (SDP), where one side offers a set of capabilities to which the other side answers, thus converging on a set of media characteristics. SIP allows the initial offer to be sent either by the calling device in the initial INVITE message (early offer) or, if the calling device chooses not to, the called party can send the initial offer in the first reliable response (delayed offer).

![[Pasted image 20241114193127.png]]
By default, Cisco Unified Communications Manager SIP trunks send the INVITE without an initial offer (delayed offer). Unified Communications Manager has the following three configurable options to enable a SIP trunk to send the offer in the INVITE (early offer):

- Media Termination Point Required
    
    Enabling this option on the SIP trunk assigns an MTP for every outbound call. This option does not support codec pass-through mode, which imposes a single codec (G.711 or G.729) limitation over the SIP trunk, thus limiting media to voice calls only. With this option enabled, calls over the trunk use MTPs assigned to the trunk rather than using calling device MTPs, which forces the media to follow the same signaling path.
    
    ## Note
    
    Enabling the Media Termination Point Required option on the SIP trunk increases MTP usage because an MTP is assigned for every inbound and outbound call rather than on an as-needed basis.
    
- Early offer support for voice and video calls mandatory (insert MTP if needed)
    
    Enabling this Cisco Unified Communications Manager configuration option on the SIP Profile associated with the SIP trunk inserts an MTP only if the calling device cannot provide Unified Communications Manager with the media characteristics required to create the outbound early offer (for example, where an inbound call to Unified Communications Manager is received on a delayed offer SIP trunk or on calls from older SCCP-based phones such as Cisco Unified IP Phones 7940 or 7960 registered to Unified Communications Manager). Unified Communications Manager creates a superset of the endpoint and MTP codec capabilities and applies the codec filtering based on the applicable region-pair settings. The outbound Offer SDP will use the IP address and port number of the MTP and voice codec supported by the calling phone.
    
    ## Note
    
    If no MTP resources are available, the call will proceed as a delayed offer call.
    
    Unified Communications Manager does not need to insert an MTP to create an outbound early offer call over a SIP trunk if Unified Communications Manager receives the inbound call by any of the following means:
    
    - On a SIP trunk using early offer
        
    - On an MGCP trunk
        
    - From a SIP-based IP phone registered to Unified Communications Manager
        
- Early offer support for voice and video calls best effort (no MTP inserted)
    
    If this Unified Communications Manager SIP profile configuration option is enabled, the SIP trunk will never use MTPs to create an early offer but will send either an early offer or a delayed offer, depending on the capabilities of the calling device.
    
    Best-effort early offer SIP trunks send outbound calls as early offer (INVITE with SDP content) in the following situations:
    
    - An inbound call to Cisco Unified Communications Manager or SME is received over a SIP trunk using early offer.
        
    - An inbound call to Cisco Unified Communications Manager or SME is received over an MGCP trunk.
        
    - A call is initiated from a SIP-based IP phone registered to Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
        
    - A call is initiated from a newer model SCCP-based Cisco Unified IP phone registered to Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
        
    
    Best-effort early offer trunks send outbound calls as delayed offer (INVITE without SDP content) in the following situations:
    
    - An inbound call to Unified Communications Manager or SME is received over a delayed offer SIP trunk.
        
    - A call is initiated from an older model SCCP-based IP phone registered to Unified Communications Manager.
        
    
    Calls over a best-effort early offer SIP trunk support voice, video, and encrypted media.
    

In general, Cisco recommends early offer support for voice and video calls best effort (no MTP inserted) for all Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition SIP trunks.
