MOH is a feature expected by most customers. The audio file played by the MOH server can keep a caller entertained while they are on hold or they can hear informational messages such as sales promotions or other useful information.

For callers to hear MOH, Cisco Unified Communications Manager must be configured to support the MOH feature. The MOH feature has two main requirements:

- An MOH server to provide the MOH audio-stream sources
    
- A Cisco Unified Communications Manager system that is configured to use the MOH streams that the MOH server provides when a call is placed on hold
    

The integrated MOH feature makes music available to any on- or off-net device that is placed on hold. On-net devices include station devices and applications that are placed on hold, consult hold, or park hold by an interactive voice response (IVR) or call distributor. Off-net users include those users who are connected through Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), or H.323 gateways.

## MOH Media Resources

The integrated MOH feature includes the media server, database administration, call control, Media Resource Manager (MRM), and media control functions. The MOH server provides the music resources and streams.

You can configure multicast MOH streaming so that external media servers can be used to provide the MOH stream. You can configure Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express and Cisco Unified Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST) gateways to act as media-streaming servers for MOH by streaming audio files that are stored in the flash memory of Cisco IOS routers that use multicast.

The Cisco Unified Communications Manager integrated MOH server supports multicast and unicast for MOH streaming. Using multicast rather than unicast for MOH streaming saves bandwidth and reduces the load on the MOH server. Saving bandwidth should not be a major issue for campus LAN environments. However, reducing load on the MOH server by reducing the number of media streams is advantageous, especially when the MOH server is colocated on the same server as the Cisco CallManager service.

## MOH Sources

![[Pasted image 20241114193238.png]]

Cisco Unified Communications Manager automatically generates MOH audio files when *.wav audio files are uploaded to the MOH server.

When the administrator imports an audio source file, the Cisco Unified Communications Manager administration interface processes the file and converts the file to the correct formats for use by the MOH server. The recommended format for audio source files includes these specifications:

- 16-bit pulse code modulation (PCM) *.wav file
    
- Stereo or mono
    
- Sample rates of 48, 32, 16, or 8 kHz
    

The MOH audio sources are numbered from 1 to 501. There are 500 custom sources and a fixed MOH audio source at the number 51.

Before using any audio source to transmit MOH, consider the legalities and ramifications of broadcasting copyrighted audio materials. Consult the customer legal department for potential issues.

## Unicast MOH

High bandwidth usage

- Each device on hold adds more bandwidth usage.

Unicast MOH consists of streams that are sent directly from the MOH server to the endpoint that requests an MOH audio stream.

A unicast MOH stream is a point-to-point, one-way audio Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) stream between the server and the endpoint device. Unicast MOH uses a separate source stream for each user or connection. As more endpoint devices go on hold via a user or network event, the number of MOH streams increases. Thus, if 20 endpoint devices are on hold, 20 streams of RTP traffic are generated over the network between the server and the devices.

These additional MOH streams can have a negative effect on network throughput and bandwidth. However, unicast MOH can be extremely useful in networks in which multicast is not enabled or devices are incapable of multicast. In such networks, unicast MOH allows administrators to take advantage of the MOH feature.

Unicast is also useful when it is important that the person on hold hears the audio file from the beginning each time it is played.

## Multicast MOH

![[Pasted image 20241114193357.png]]

Multicast MOH consists of streams that are sent from the MOH server to a multicast group IP address. Endpoints that request an MOH audio stream can join multicast MOH, as needed.

A multicast MOH stream is a point-to-multipoint, one-way audio RTP stream between the MOH server and the multicast group IP address. Multicast MOH conserves system resources and bandwidth because it enables multiple users to use the same audio source stream to provide MOH. Thus, if 20 devices are on hold, as few as one stream of RTP traffic might be generated over the network.

Multicast is an extremely attractive technology for the deployment of a service such as MOH because it greatly reduces the CPU impact on the source device and the bandwidth consumption for delivery over common paths.

However, multicast MOH can be problematic in situations in which a network is not enabled for multicast or the endpoint devices are incapable of processing multicast.

Multicast MOH must be planned and coordinated with the networking group. Enterprise networks can have multiple applications using multicast functionality. Care must be taken that multicast MOH does not conflict with existing functionality.

## MOH Audio Source Selection

![[Pasted image 20241114193417.png]]

This figure describes how the MOH audio source file and MOH audio server are selected in Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

The basic operation of MOH in a Cisco Unified Communications environment consists of a hold initiator (holder) and a holdee. The holder is the endpoint user or network application that places a call on hold, and the holdee is the endpoint user or device that is placed on hold.

There are two types of hold in Cisco Unified Communications Manager:

- **User Hold:** When a holder presses the “Hold” button or softkey. People can be “On Hold” for extended periods of time. It is common to play music with some sort of messaging on User Hold.
    
- **Network Hold:** When a holder presses a conference, transfer, or park button or softkey. People tend to be on hold for shorter amount of time in these cases. Music is the most common audio source for Network Hold.
    

The MOH stream that an endpoint receives is determined by a combination of the User Hold MOH Audio Source that is configured for the holder and the prioritized list of MOH resources (MRGL) that is configured for the holdee.

The User Hold MOH Audio Source determines which audio file will be streamed when the holder puts a call on hold. The list of MOH resources determines the server from which the holdee receives the MOH stream.

In the figure, if phones A and B are on a call and phone B (the holder) places phone A (the holdee) on hold, phone A hears the MOH audio source that is configured for phone B (Audio 2). However, phone A receives this MOH audio stream from the resource or server that is configured for phone A.
