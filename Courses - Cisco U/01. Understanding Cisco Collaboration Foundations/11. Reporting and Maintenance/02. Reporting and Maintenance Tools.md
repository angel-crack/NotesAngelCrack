This topic describes the reporting tools that you can use to proactively monitor and maintain the network, including Cisco Unified Reporting, Cisco CDR Analysis and Reporting (Cisco CAR), and Cisco Disaster Recovery System (Cisco DRS).
## Troubleshooting Tools: Overview

![[Pasted image 20241115092342.png]]

The image shows an overview of the four tools discussed in this module:

- **Cisco Unified Real-Time Monitoring Tool (RTMT):** Used to gather performance statistics, view trace files, generate call flow diagrams, view syslog data, and set alerts to notify administrators when thresholds have been reached on services.
- **Cisco Unified Reporting:** Generates reports that can be run manually or scheduled, which are vital for proactive management of the network and resource usage.
- **Cisco CDR (Call Detail Records) Analysis and Reporting (CAR):** Allows administrators, managers and end users, to view usage reports. These reports can be emailed according to a custom schedule, which allows users to monitor their spending of telephony resources.
- **Cisco Disaster Recovery System (DRS):** Used to back up and restore the entire Cisco Unified Communications configuration and database.

## Cisco Unified Reports

Cisco Unified Reporting provides a snapshot of cluster data without requiring multiple steps to find the data. It facilitates the gathering of data from existing sources, comparing the data, and reporting irregularities.

![[Pasted image 20241115092402.png]]

A report combines data from one or more sources on one or more servers into one output view. For example, the administrator can view a report that shows the hosts file for all servers in the cluster.

The application gathers information from the publisher server and each subscriber server. A report provides data for all active cluster nodes that are accessible at the time that the report is generated.

Cisco Unified Reporting includes the following capabilities:
- A user interface for generating, archiving, and downloading reports
- Notifications if a report will take excessive time to generate or will consume excessive CPU

**Data Sources**

The reports that Cisco Unified Reporting generates might use any of these sources:

- Cisco Unified Communications Manager RTMT counters
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager database
- Disk files
    1. Trace files
    2. Logs
- CLI output
    1. Cisco Unified Reporting uses the CLI output for generating reports, for example, to display the hardware information.
- Cisco RIS (Real-Time Information Server)

The system report named “Report Descriptions” provides the information sources that are used for a displayed report.

Cisco Unified Reporting runs as an application on the Cisco Tomcat service. The Cisco Tomcat service is activated at Cisco Unified Communications Manager installation. Ensure that Cisco Unified Communications Manager is running on all servers in the cluster. The report subsystem gathers information from other servers by using the remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism via HTTPS. Ensure that the HTTPS port is open and the Cisco Tomcat service is running on the server to successfully generate a report.

## Cisco Unified Reports: Sample Report

At the top of every report, an icon (check mark in a green square) displays if the report was successfully generated. The date and time that the report was generated is included in every report. The report also displays a short description of the information and data that is included in the report. The report can be downloaded to the local hard drive as an XML file using the icon in the top-right corner of the report.

![[Pasted image 20241115092431.png]]

The content can vary among various reports. In the example, the report displays the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Data Summary. This report provides an overview of system configuration summaries. For example, the report includes the number of Cisco Unified Communications Manager nodes in the cluster, the number of NTP servers, and the number of configured device pools.

Although Cisco Unified Reporting can be used for various administrator tasks, it is mainly used for these tasks:

- Troubleshooting
    1. Cisco Unified Reporting provides information that allows the administrator to gather the facts and consider possibilities, and can speed up the troubleshooting process.
    2. Depending on the issue, reports can be used to observe results.
- Maintenance
    1. For daily administrator tasks, Cisco Unified Reporting can find configuration or load mismatches.
    2. Voicemail and system information can be summarized in a system overview.
- System analysis
    1. The Unified Communications Manager Phone Feature List report can be used to find phones supporting a particular feature.
    2. Cisco Unified Reporting can display a summary showing how many phones of a specified type are in use.

## Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR Tool

As its primary function, Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR generates reports about the users of Cisco Unified Communications Manager and generates reports on the system status regarding call processing. Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR also performs CAR database management activities. Administrators can perform these tasks by either pulling the reports manually, or scheduling the reports to take place automatically.

![[Pasted image 20241115092440.png]]

All Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR reports use Call Detail Record (CDR) data. Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR processes the CDRs from flat files that the CDR repository service places in the CDR repository folder structure. Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR processes CDRs at a scheduled time and frequency. By default, CDR data loads continuously 24 hours per day and seven days per week. However, you can set the loading time, interval, and duration as needed. In addition, the default setting loads only CDR records. Call Management records (CMRs) are not loaded, by default.

- **Administrators** are allowed to use all the features of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR tool. For example, they can generate system reports to view system performance, verify load balancing, and troubleshoot.
- **Managers** can generate reports for users, departments, and quality of service (QoS) to help with call monitoring for budgeting or security purposes. Reports can also be used for determining the voice quality of the calls (for example, to ensure compliance with service level agreements).
- **End users** can generate a billing report for their calls.

CMRs include jitter, lost packets, the amount of data that was sent and received during the call, and latency. CDR data comprises CDRs and CMRs collectively. A single call can result in the generation of several CDRs and CMRs. Cisco Unified Communications Manager records information regarding each call in CDRs and CMRs. CDRs and CMRs, known collectively as CDR data, serve as the basic information source for Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR.

## CAR Tool: Administrators

Users who have been identified as Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR administrators have complete control over the Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR system.

![[Pasted image 20241115092453.png]]

Any user can act as a Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR administrator. However, the user must be added to the Cisco CAR Administrators User Group in the Cisco Unified CM Administration web interface. You can modify all the parameters that relate to the system and the reports.

## CAR Tool: Managers

Managers can access the Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR tool and view various reports for end users who report to them.

![[Pasted image 20241115092500.png]]

The Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR tool allows managers to access their own individual bill (when their Owner User ID is configured on a device or device profile) and view bills or reports of associated users. To associate an end user with a manager, add the Manager User ID value in the End User Configuration window in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration web interface.

## Note

The configured manager must be a member of the Standard CCM End Users group to allow web access to the Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR tool.

You can configure automatically generated reports. When enabled, managers who are configured can receive those reports at their Mail ID, which is configured in the End User Configuration window.

## CAR Tool: End Users

Individual phone bills provide call information for the date range that the end user specifies. End users can generate, view, or mail summary or detailed information about their individual phone bills. Those Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR administrators who are also application users cannot generate this report.

![[Pasted image 20241115092512.png]]

To configure an end user to use the Cisco Unified Communications Manager CAR tool, configure the Standard CCM End Users group in the end-user configuration window. To associate a device or device profile with an end user, configure the Owner User ID in the Device or Device Profile Configuration window. When the Owner User ID is configured, the end user can view the individual bill for these devices.

## Disaster Recovery System

The Disaster Recovery System provides complete data backup and restore capabilities for all servers in a Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster, Cisco Unity Connection, or Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service.

![[Pasted image 20241115092526.png]]

The Disaster Recovery System allows administrators to perform regularly scheduled automatic or user-invoked manual data backups.

The Disaster Recovery System performs a cluster-level backup, which means that the system collects backups for all servers in a cluster to a central location and archives the backup data to an SFTP destination.

The Disaster Recovery System restores its own settings (backup device settings and schedule settings) as part of the platform backup or restore. The Disaster Recovery System backs up and restores drfDevice.xml and drfSchedule.xml files. When the server is restored with these files, the administrator does not need to reconfigure the Disaster Recovery System backup device and schedule.

When performing a system data restoration, the administrator can choose which nodes should be restored. The Disaster Recovery System includes the following capabilities:

- A user interface for performing backup and restore tasks
- A distributed system architecture for performing backup and restore functions
- Scheduled backups
- Archive backups to a remote SFTP server

## Note

Before the administrator restores a server, ensure that the version that is installed on the server matches the version of the backup file that should be restored. The Disaster Recovery System supports only exactly matching versions of the appliances for restore procedures.

## Disaster Recovery System: Interface

The Disaster Recovery System web interface contains two menus, for backup tasks and for restore tasks.

![[Pasted image 20241115092535.png]]

To access the Disaster Recovery System, select **Disaster Recovery System** from the Navigation drop-down list in the upper-right corner of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service, or Cisco Unity Connection administration interface window.

The web interface can also be directly accessed from **https://Server_IP/drf/**. The Disaster Recovery System feature is also available in Cisco Unified Contact Center Express. Log in to the Disaster Recovery System by using the same administrator username and password that is used for the Cisco Unified Operating System administration web interface.
