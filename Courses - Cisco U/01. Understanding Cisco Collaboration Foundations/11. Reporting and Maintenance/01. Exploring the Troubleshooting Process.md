This topic will describe the problem-solving model and troubleshooting methodology.

## Problem-Solving Model Overview

This problem-solving model is an example of a systematic troubleshooting method.

1. **Define the problem:** Analyze the network problem and create a clear problem statement. Define the symptoms of the problem and the potential causes.
2. **Gather the facts:** Gather the facts that you need to isolate possible causes and to narrow the list of potential causes. In an ideal situation, you are able to narrow the problems down to the root cause. If a root cause cannot be determined, exclude as many options as possible by gathering facts and using appropriate tools and methods.
3. **Consider possibilities:** Consider the most likely possible causes, based on the facts.
4. **Create action plan:** Begin with the most likely cause and devise a plan.
5. **Implement the action plan.**
6. **Analyze the results:** Observe the results to determine whether the problem has been resolved.
7. **Repeat the process:** If the problem has _not_ been resolved, create an action plan to resolve the next most probable cause on the list. Return to the action plan and repeat the process.
8. **Document the facts:** If the problem is resolved, consider the process complete and document any changes, the root cause of the problem, and the steps that resolved the problem.

## Troubleshooting IP Phone Registration

IP phone registration issues are one of the most common types of problems faced. As there are many components and steps involved, it is easiest to follow a "divide-and-conquer" methodology, breaking down the process into different phases and then tackling each phase individually.

## Divide-and-Conquer Methodology

A "divide-and-conquer" troubleshooting methodology helps when trying to isolate problems with IP phone registration and is the simplest methodology. Each section can be looked at separately.

IP phone registration issues can be broken down into key areas of failure that are based on the registration sequence:

- **Local to the IP phone:** Firmware and software errors, power issues, and hardware failure
- **LAN:** VLAN or Cisco Catalyst Switch mismatches and PoE misconfigurations 
- **DHCP:** Lack of an option 150 in the DHCP scope, which provides the TFTP address needed in the next phase.
- **TFTP file download issues:** Misconfigurations or incorrect firmware files
- **Cisco Unified Communications Manager registration:** Includes autoregistration settings, protocol mismatches, incorrect MAC address definitions, and so on

A good understanding of the separate areas of the registration process usually results in faster troubleshooting.

Start troubleshooting on the end device, the IP phone. Look at the status messages to identify any error messages. In this example, there is an error message stating “File Not Found: HW-CIPC-1.cnf.xml”. This configuration file should be created by the Cisco Unified Communications Manager when the phone is added to the configuration. Given that the error is about the file not being found, it makes sense to now jump to step 5 to confirm that this file exists.

When navigating to Device > Phone on the Cisco Unified Communications Manager, you can see the phone listed as “HQ-CIPC-1” and showing a status of Unregistered. The IP phone is looking for a file called “HW-CIPC-1”. There is a mismatch in spelling between the IP phone “HW-CIPC-1” and the Cisco Unified Communications Manager “HQ-CIPC-1”. When the name is changed on the Cisco IP Communicator, the phone should then register.
