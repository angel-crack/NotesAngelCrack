This topic describes the Cisco Unified Real-Time Monitoring Tool (RTMT).

## Cisco Unified RTMT Interface

A category comprises a group of monitored performance counters (for example, Disk Usage and Critical Services in the System submenu, or Call Activity and Device Summary in the Voice/Video submenu).

The bottom toolbar in the Cisco Unified RTMT monitoring pane contains tabs and each tab has an associated category name. All performance counters that are monitored in a specific tab belong to that specific category. The bottom toolbar displays any categories that the administrator accesses during a Cisco Unified RTMT session.

Each submenu contains different categories to access monitoring or troubleshooting tasks, some of which depend on the platform that is being monitored. These submenus are as follows:

- **System:** Contains system and platform health monitoring, such as, CPU, memory, and the current disk usage. This submenu allows administrators to monitor the system summary, monitor server resources, work with performance counters, work with alerts, collect traces, and view syslog messages. It also gives the administrator access to Trace & Log Central to collect and view trace files for different services. The Syslog Viewer displays log messages from the system itself and from the appliance.
    
- **Voice/Video:** Displays appliance-specific statistics and summaries. This submenu allows administrators to view Cisco Unified Communications Manager summary information on the server, monitor call-processing information, view and search for devices, monitor services, and computer telephony integration (CTI). This item is only available when Cisco Unified RTMT is connected to a Cisco Unified Communications Manager server.
    
- **AnalysisManager:** Displays configuration or license summaries and includes tools such as Call Path Analysis. This item is only available when Cisco Unified RTMT is connected to a Cisco Unified Communications Manager server.
    
- **Unity Connection:** Allows administrators to view the Port Monitor tool and displays appliance-specific statistics and summaries. This item is only available when Cisco Unified RTMT is connected to a Cisco Unity Connection server.
    
- **IM and Presence:** Allows administrators to view summaries for Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service and Cisco Jabber. This item is only available when Cisco Unified RTMT is connected to a Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service server.
    

## RTMT: Syslog Viewer

The Syslog Viewer displays various error messages from the system, application, and security log.

To access the syslogs of a specific node, select the node in the top of the window. When the node is chosen, the logs appear in the window below. Open a log file folder and click messages. The syslog messages from the chosen folder are now displayed.

To filter the results, choose an option in the Filter By drop-down list box that is displayed when you click Filter. To remove the filter, click Clear Filter. All logs display after the filter is cleared. To automatically refresh the screen, check the Auto Refresh check box in the upper-right corner of the window.

## Note

Syslog messages also display the syslog definition, which includes recommended actions, in an adjacent pane when you double-click the syslog message.

## RTMT: Alert Central

Cisco Unified RTMT displays both preconfigured alerts and custom alerts in Alert Central. Cisco Unified RTMT organizes the alerts under the applicable tabs—System, Voice/Video, Unity Connection, IM and Presence, and Custom. The administrator can enable or disable preconfigured and custom alerts in Alert Central, but the administrator cannot delete preconfigured alerts.

To sort alert information in the Alert Status pane, click the up/down arrow that is displayed in the column heading. For example, click the up/down arrow that displays in the Enabled or In Safe Range column. The administrator can sort alert history information by clicking the up/down arrow in the columns in the Alert History pane. To see alert history that is out of view in the pane, use the scroll bar on the right side of the Alert History pane.

To enable, disable, or remove an alert, from the Alert Status window, right-click the alert and choose Disable Alert, Enable Alert, or Remove Alert, depending on what you want to accomplish.

To customize alarm settings, right-click a specific alert and choose Set Alert/Properties. The administrator can define different options such as threshold, alarm frequency and schedules, or active email settings.
