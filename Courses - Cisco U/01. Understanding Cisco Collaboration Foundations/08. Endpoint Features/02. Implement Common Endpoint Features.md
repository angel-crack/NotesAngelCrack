## Enable Call Park

To understand Call Park, let’s look at an example. An outside caller dials into your company, John Doe answers the call and the caller says that he is looking for Jane White. John knows that Jane is currently in the server room next door to his office but that room does not have a phone. John pushes the Call Park button on his phone and is notified that the call has been placed into a parking bay with extension 18000. This parking bay is purely a dialable extension number. John then walks next door and notifies Jane that there is a call for her on extension 18000. Jane can pick up any phone in the building and dial 18000 to retrieve the call.

## Create a Shared Line

A shared line allows for more than one device to have the same directory number. When someone calls the shared line, multiple phones ring at the same time, allowing for quicker response times as more people are notified of the incoming call.

### Step 20



From the CCM administration page, select **Device > Phone**.

### Step 21

### Step 36



Notice that the "Associated devices" section shows that this directory number is used by HQ-CIPC-1.

### Step 37



Scroll down to the section titled “Line 2 on Device HQ-CIPC-2”.

Notice this section's fields are still blank and have not been populated from the original directory number. These fields are unique per device and can be set uniquely for each device with the directory number.

### Step 38



In the “Line 2 on Device HQ-CIPC-2” section, enter the following information:

- Display (Caller ID): **HQ IT Shared Line**

## Create Call Pickup Group

Cisco Unified Communications Manager allows multiple lines to be grouped into pickup groups. A unique pickup group number identifies each pickup group, which is part of the call routing table in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. A phone line can be assigned to one pickup group.

If a phone rings, but nobody can answer the call, another user can pick up the call by using the Call Pickup feature if the ringing phone is in the same pickup group as the phone of the user who wants to pick up the call. The administrator can define when other Call Pickup group members are notified about an incoming call in their Call Pickup group. The notification type also can be modified to allow audible and visual notifications. Within the same group, the longest alerting call (longest ringing time) is picked up first if multiple incoming calls occur in the group.

### Step 51



Change the Call Pickup Group Notification Timer from 6 seconds to **10** seconds.

This setting determines how long the user’s phone must ring before other members of the call pickup group will be notified about the unanswered call.

### Step 52



In the section titled “Call Information Display for Call Pickup Group Notification”, select the **Calling Party Information** and **Called Party Information** check boxes, then click **Save**.

This setting will allow the user to see who is calling, and who is the original person called.

### Step 53

### Step 54



**Other Group Call Pickup**

The Other Group Call Pickup feature allows users to pick up incoming calls in a group that is associated with their own group. Cisco Unified Communications Manager automatically searches for incoming calls in the associated groups to make the call connection when the user activates this feature from an IP phone. Use the OPickUp softkey for this type of Call Pickup. When more than one associated group exists, the priority of answering calls for the associated group goes from the first associated group to the last associated group.

### Step 55
