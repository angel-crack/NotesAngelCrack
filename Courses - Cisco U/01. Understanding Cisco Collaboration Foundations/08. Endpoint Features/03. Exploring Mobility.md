Cisco Unified Communications Manager provides a wide range of telephony features for end users. This topic describes Cisco Extension Mobility and Cisco Mobile Connect.

## Cisco Extension Mobility: Overview

The Cisco Extension Mobility feature allows users to log in to any IP phone and have their individual user-specific phone configuration applied to the phone they are using. Users are reachable at their personal extension regardless of their location and the physical phone they use.

Cisco Extension Mobility is implemented as a phone service and traditionally works within a Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster. Cisco Extension Mobility Cross Cluster (EMCC) support was introduced with Cisco Unified Communications Manager version 8.0.

Cisco Extension Mobility allows users to log in to any phone and get their individual user-specific phone configuration applied to the phone that they are using. Users can be reached at their personal directory number, regardless of the location or physical phone.

The user-specific configuration is stored in device profiles. After successful login, the phone is reconfigured with user-specific parameters; other (device)-specific parameters remain the same. If a user is associated with multiple device profiles, the user must select the device profile to be used.

## Cisco Extension Mobility: Login Process

The following process is used to log in to a phone:

1. The user presses the Services button on the phone and selects Cisco Extension Mobility from the list of phone services available on the phone.
    
2. The user enters the required ID and PIN.
    
3. If the user ID and PIN are correct, Cisco Extension Mobility selects the device profile that is associated with the user.
    
4. Cisco Unified Communications Manager updates the phone configuration with the settings of the selected device profile. User-specific device-level parameters, lines, and other phone buttons are updated with user-specific settings.
    
5. The IP phone is reset and loads the updated configuration.

Users can now utilize the phone as if they were using their own phone at their home location. Directory numbers, speed dials, Message Waiting Indicator (MWI), and other settings are all correct, regardless of the location and the IP phone being used.

Users can log out by pressing the Services button and choosing Logout in the Cisco Extension Mobility service. For users do not log out, one of three scenarios can be configured:

- The system will automatically log out a user after the expiration of the maximum login time.
    
- The system will automatically log out a user when the user logs into another phone
    
- Another user can log out the previous user if they have left the phone logged in.
    

These settings are configured in the Service Parameters menu.

## Note

If a user is associated with more than one device profile, all associated profiles are displayed and the user must select one.

## Cisco Extension Mobility: Default Device Profile

Administrators can configure each IP phone to support Cisco Extension Mobility by using the default device profile. This procedure allows users who do not have a user device profile for a particular IP phone to use Cisco Extension Mobility with that phone.

A device profile defines the attributes of a particular device. A device profile includes information such as the phone template, user locale, subscribed services, and speed dials.

The device profile is not associated with a physical phone. It includes all the properties of a device except the properties that are explicitly tied to the device, such as MAC address or directory URL. When a device profile has been loaded onto a device, the device adopts the attributes of that device profile.

When a user logs in to a phone that is configured for Cisco Extension Mobility and the user has a user device profile that is configured for that phone, the user device profile replaces the existing configuration of the device. When a user logs out, the logout profile replaces the user device profile.

## Mobile Connect: Overview

The Cisco Mobile Connect feature enables users to receive business calls using a single phone number, regardless of the device that is used for a call. Cisco Mobile Connect allows users to answer incoming calls on the office phone or at the remote destination and to pick up in-progress calls on the office phone or remote destination without losing the connection. Once the call is offered to both the desktop and remote destination phones, the user can answer at any of those phones.

When answering the call on one of the remote destination phones or on the IP desk phone, the user has the option to hand off the call to the office phone. Active calls on the office phones can be handed off to a remote phone. An end-user can use a single voicemail box. Each end-user can configure access lists that permit or deny calling numbers that can ring a specific remote destination. Cisco Mobile Connect also supports call logging. Enterprise calls are logged regardless of the device that is used (enterprise phone or remote phone).

Mobility users can have up to 10 remote destinations that are configured and associated with their remote destination profile. A remote destination represents a single public switched telephone network (PSTN) phone number where a user can be reached. Call routing timers can be configured for each remote destination to adjust the amount of time a call will be extended to a particular remote phone. Call routing timers also configure the amount of time to wait before extending the call and the amount of time that must pass before a call can be answered at the remote phone.

## Cisco Mobile Connect: Incoming Calls to Office Phone

As an example, if John Doe receives a call that is placed to his business number (408-555-1001), both his office phone and remote destinations (his cell phone and home phone) will ring.

If John is traveling to the office, he can accept the call on his cell phone. After he arrives at the office, the call can be picked up while the call is in progress by pressing a single key at the office IP phone. The call continues on the office IP phone without any interruption, and the handover from cell phone to IP phone is not noticed by the other party on the call.

## Cisco Mobile Connect: Internal Calls to Office Phone

![[Pasted image 20241107090333.png]]


In this example, Jane White calls John Doe on his office phone by dialing his extension (11001). Johnâ€™s office phone rings and after the ring threshold his home phone and cell phone will ring. If John was at a client site, or working from home, he would be able to receive the call from Jane White.

## Cisco Mobile Connect: Internal Calls Placed from Remote Phone

In the next example, extension 11001 has a Mobile Connect remote destination 408-971-7272 (home phone of John Doe.). When John places a call from his home phone to an enterprise PSTN number of a colleague (by dialing 408-555-1002); the called colleague (Jane White) will see the call coming from the internal directory number 11001 instead of the external home phone number.

To recognize Cisco Mobile Connect remote destinations, the mobile connect remote destination number must match the Automatic Number Identification (ANI) of the incoming call. Typically, mobile connect remote destinations include an access code, which must be prefixed to the incoming ANI in order for the source to be recognized as a mobile connect remote destination.

Alternatively, the Cisco Communications Manager Service Parameter Matching Caller ID with Remote Destination can be set to Partial Match and the Number of Digits for Caller ID Partial Match parameter can be specified. This number specifies how many digits of the incoming ANI must match a configured remote destination number (starting with the least significant digit).

If the source of the call is not recognized as a mobile connect remote destination, the PSTN number of the remote destination is used for the calling number and it is not changed to the internal directory number.
