This topic will describe the installation and configuration to support Cisco Jabber.

## Cisco Jabber Product Overview

Cisco Jabber is a client tool that includes the most commonly used Cisco Unified Communications tools in a single software package. With Cisco Jabber, end users can place audio and video calls, either controlling their associated IP phone or in softphone mode, when the IP phone is not available or the user is not currently at the office desk.

The Contact List window shows the current presence status of the contacts of the user. Each user can create a personal contact list to subscribe to the presence status of the presence-enabled users. The chat feature is based on the Jabber XCP (Extensible Communications Platform), which uses XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) as the chat protocol. XCP supports point-to-point and group chat, also called multiuser chat or text conferencing.

The applications in the Cisco Jabber family of products are:

- Cisco Jabber for Android
- Cisco Jabber for iPhone and iPad
- Cisco Jabber for Mac
- Cisco Jabber for Windows


## Deployment Modes

![[Pasted image 20241105220216.png]]

Cisco Jabber has a few different deployment models:

- **On-premises:** Has all resources located on your corporate network and is managed and maintained by onsite personnel. On-premises can be further broken down into:

1. **Full UC:** Deploys full UC mode, enables instant messaging and presence capabilities, provisions voicemail and conferencing capabilities, and provisions users with devices for audio and video.

2. **IM-only:** Deploys IM-only mode, enables instant messaging and presence capabilities. Does not provision users with devices.

3. **Phone****only models:** The user's primary authentication to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. To deploy phone-only mode, provision users with devices for audio and video capabilities. You can also provision users with additional services such as voicemail.

- **Cloud-based deployment:** Model in which Cisco Webex hosts services. You manage and monitor your cloud-based deployment with the Cisco Webex Administration Tool.

- **Hybrid cloud-based deployment:** A combination of on-premises and cloud-based.


## Deployment: On-Premises Full UC Mode

In an On-Premises Full Unified Communications Mode, all services can be activated on the Cisco Jabber client by using Service Profiles that point the client to each of the services available on the network. There is a requirement for the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Instant Messaging and Presence (Cisco IMP) Server.

The following services are available in an on-premises deployment with Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service:

- **Presence**: Publish availability and subscribe to other users' availability through Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service.
- **Instant Messaging (IM)**: Send and receive IMs through Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service.
- **File Transfers**: Send and receive files and screenshots through Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service.
- **Audio Calls**: Place audio calls through desk phone devices or computers through Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
- **Video**: Place video calls through Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
- **Voicemail**: Send and receive voice messages through Cisco Unity Connection.
- **Conferencing**: Integrate with one of the following:

1. Cisco Webex Meetings Center: Provides hosted meeting capabilities.
2. Cisco Webex Meetings Server: Provides on-premises meeting capabilities.


## Deployment: On-Premises Phone Only Mode

Phone Only mode is simplest of the modes as it offers the least amount of integration. A connection to Cisco Unified Communications Manager is all that is needed to get Cisco Jabber to make and receive calls. The requirement for Cisco Unity Connection and Cisco Webex is optional to allow for additional features. The installation of a Cisco IMP server is not required.

The following services are available in a phone-only mode deployment:

- **Contact**: Applicable to mobile clients only. Cisco Jabber updates the contact information from the phone's contact address book.
- **Audio Calls**: Place audio calls through desk phone devices or on computers through Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
- **Video**: Place video calls through Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
- **Voicemail**: Send and receive voice messages through Cisco Unity Connection.
- **Conferencing**: Integrate with one of the following:

1. Cisco Webex Meetings Center: Provides hosted meeting capabilities.
2. Cisco Webex Meetings Server: Provides on-premises meeting capabilities.


## Note

Cisco Jabber for Android and Cisco Jabber for iPhone and iPad do not support conferencing in phone mode.

## Deployment: Cloud-Based

In a Cloud-Based deployment, all services are hosted in the cloud through Cisco Webex hosts services. You can manage and monitor your cloud-based deployment with the Cisco Webex Administration Tool.

## Cisco Jabber Operational Modes

![[Pasted image 20241105220801.png]]


Cisco Jabber can either be used in Deskphone mode or in Softphone mode. Each mode has the following characteristics:

- **Deskphone mode**: Cisco Jabber uses CTIQBE (Computer Telephony Integration Quick Buffer Encoding) to control an IP phone. The IP phone must be registered with Cisco Unified Communications Manager and associated to the end user. When multiple IP phones are associated to an end user and are registered to Cisco Unified Communications Manager, the end user can choose which IP phone should be used in Cisco Jabber for placing calls.

- **Softphone mode**: Cisco Jabber activates the associated softphone based on the Cisco Unified CSF (Client Services Framework), which registers the softphone with Cisco Unified Communications Manager via SIP. This activation requires that the administrator has correctly created a Cisco Unified CSF device in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration web interface and has associated the CSF device to the appropriate end user.


## Cisco Jabber Information Flow in Deskphone Mode

When using Cisco Jabber in Deskphone mode, Cisco Jabber registers at the Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service server and obtains the configuration file. Cisco Jabber connects to the Cisco Unified Communications Manager hostname or IP address and logs in with the end-user credentials.

![[Pasted image 20241105220840.png]]


With the Cisco Unified Communications Manager IP Phone service, Cisco Jabber receives the list of controlled and user-associated end devices and uses the CTIQBE interface to control the IP phone. The user can select the IP phone when multiple IP phones are registered and associated to the end user.

Cisco Jabber uses XMPP for chat features and sends all instant messages to Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service.

## Cisco Jabber Information Flow in Softphone Mode

When no IP phone is available or a user is not at their desk, the softphone mode allows the user to place and receive calls. The Cisco Unified CSF framework uses SIP REGISTER messages to register on Cisco Unified Communications Manager as a Cisco Unified CSF device, using SIP as the signaling protocol. When the connection is established, Cisco Jabber downloads the configuration file from Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

![[Pasted image 20241105221047.png]]

The configuration file contains the list of Cisco Unified Communications Manager primary and failover server addresses and the transport protocol for Cisco Jabber to use in softphone mode to connect to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. After Cisco Jabber downloads the file successfully, the configuration information is made available to other Cisco Jabber subsystems.

Each time that Cisco Jabber tries to download the configuration file, the application attempts to contact the primary TFTP server. If the primary TFTP server does not respond, Cisco Jabber fails over to the backup TFTP server. If all TFTP server connections fail, Cisco Jabber tries to load the last valid downloaded configuration from the local hard disk.

Cisco Jabber uses XMPP to Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service for instant messages and roster updates.
