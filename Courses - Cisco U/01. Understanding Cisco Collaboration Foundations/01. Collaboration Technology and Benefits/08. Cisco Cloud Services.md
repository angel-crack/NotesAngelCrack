The main benefits of a cloud deployment include:

- **Faster deployment:** Cloud services can be up and running in days rather than months.

- **Pay for what you need:** Cloud services are fully scalable and can be purchased per user, allowing customers to deploy exactly what they need.

- **Expand and contract with business requirements:** Cloud services are flexible and can be increased and decreased as the needs of a business change.

- **Reduced onsite expertise:** Endpoints are the only devices on the customer site. Configuration of endpoints is simplified using a wizard in most cases which can be configured by an end-user, reducing the need for support functions on every site.

- **Reduced large upfront investment:** No requirement to purchase servers to run management software. Some investment in endpoints may be required upfront. Running costs are operating expenses rather than capital expenditures.

From the main Cisco Webex Teams interface, you can chat to individuals (People) or create a space for multiple people. Spaces can exist on their own or can be part of a team with multiple spaces. Within a space or individual chat, you can also share files, launch, or schedule a meeting. Users can be invited from outside your organization as well as internal. Cisco Webex Teams provides presence information on users and a custom status capability.

Meetings can be set up directly from the Webex Application or from a Webex device. When setting a meeting up using the app, participants can use any nearby video system without having to manually dial the device. Participants can also connect to meetings using standard SIP devices, dial in from a phone, or Microsoft Skype for Business. Each meeting is connected to a space, either because it was launched from one or a new one will be created. All whiteboard sessions, files shared, and chat within the meeting will be available after the meeting by all participants.

## Cisco Hosted Collaboration Solutions

![[Pasted image 20241103150801.png]]

Cisco Hosted Collaboration Solutions (HCS) are partner hosted rather than Cisco hosted. Essentially all the component parts you would deploy in an on-premises solution are available within an HCS solution. Deployments can be fully partner-hosted and managed, hosted on the customer premises but managed by the partner or a dedicated data center built for a customer and managed by the partner. Smaller customers may share devices such as Cisco Unified Communications Manager in a multitenant environment, while larger customers have an independent environment.

On top of the devices normally found in an on-premises solution, Cisco HCS also includes Cisco Hosted Collaboration (HCM-F), mediation fulfillment which performs centralized management for the entire Cisco HCS solution. High-Performance Compression Module (HCM) performs aggregation and provides a central connection to the service provider cloud. HCM provides northbound interface (NBI) services to integrate Cisco HCS with the service provider business support system (BSS), operations support system (OSS), and Manager of Managers (MoM).
