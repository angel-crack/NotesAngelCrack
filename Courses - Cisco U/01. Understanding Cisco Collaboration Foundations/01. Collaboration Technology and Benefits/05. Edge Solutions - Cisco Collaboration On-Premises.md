## Cisco Voice Router

Cisco routers can have a number of different interface cards installed in them. Cards can be installed to connect to T1, E1, or BRI interfaces to enable connectivity to the PSTN. Routers with voice connectivity are often referred to as a voice gateway. Calls are routed from Cisco Unified Communications Manager to the voice gateway using SIP/H.323 or MGCP. The gateway converts the call signaling and media to a circuit-switched format used on ISDN networks.

## Cisco Expressway

Cisco Expressway is used to manage three types of edge communications.

## B2B Communication

Business-to-business (B2B) communication enables calls to be made from an internal telepresence system to a telepresence system at an external site and vice versa. When an internal device makes a call to an external device, the Expressway-C routes the call to the Expressway-E on the other side of the corporate firewall. The Expressway-E then uses DNS to locate the IP address of the external company's firewall traversal device (it does not have to be an Expressway). The call signaling messages are then sent to the external company.

The Expressway-C maintains a keepalive signal to the Expressway-E device. When an external call is received by the Expressway-E, the Expressway-E can reply back to the Expressway-C's keepalive message with a call set up message. When the call setup message is sent to the endpoint, then media negotiation is completed over the existing link. Media channels are always set up from the inside to the outside, enabling the firewall ports to be opened from the inside to the outside.

## Mobile and Remote Access

Mobile and remote access allow mobile workers to use internal collaboration services from the public network without the need for a VPN. The external device uses DNS to locate the Cisco Expressway-E device and send their registration messages to the Expressway-E. The Expressway-E sends these messages onto the Expressway-C and subsequently onto the Cisco Unified Communications Manager. The phone, Jabber endpoint, or video device then registers as normal. As far as the endpoint is concerned, it is talking directly to the Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

## Hybrid Services

Expressway is also used to connect cloud services to on-premises services in a hybrid deployment. Hybrid services that use Expressway include:

1. **Hybrid Call Service:** This service allows a Webex Teams customer with Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Business Edition 6000, or Cisco Hosted Collaboration Solution to integrate their current call control with the Cisco Collaboration Cloud.

2. **Hybrid Calendar Service:** This service allows any Webex Teams customer to enable scheduling of Webex meetings with an automatically created and associated Webex Team space. By adding @meet to the location field of the exchange appointment, all attendees of the appointment are automatically added to the Webex Teams room. With @Webex in the location field, the details of the user's personal Webex Meetings room are automatically added to the invitation sent for the appointment.

3. **Hybrid Directory Service:** This service allows any Webex Teams customer to synchronize their current Active Directory with the Cisco Webex Cloud. This service makes onboarding users to the cloud simple and more secure.


## Cisco Unified Border Element

Cisco Unified Border Element, also called the Session Border Controller (SBC), is also used to connect Cisco on-premises devices to external devices, usually via an Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP). Cisco Unified Border Element is an additional function of a Cisco Router.

Individual SIP trunks can also be set up for customers or partners if required. Like Expressway, Cisco Unified Border Element can be used to interwork calls and modify media ports as required. Each call made through a Cisco Unified Border Element is split into two separate call legs. Cisco Border Element can handle large volumes of calls and is typically used for voice, while Expressway Business-to-Business is typically used for Video.
