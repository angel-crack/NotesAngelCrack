Cisco call control devices, including Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Expressway, and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express, provide the following features to endpoint devices.

- **Call processing:** Setting up and tearing down of calls, including the routing of media channels and negotiation of codecs.

- **Endpoint registration:** Endpoints registered to the call control device are listed in a database mapping user-facing names and numbers to IP addresses. Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express also provide endpoint devices with configuration files.

- **Phone Feature Administration:** The features available depend on the call control device, but as an example, Cisco Unified Communications Manager administers features such as Extension Mobility, Device Mobility, Call Park, and Call Pickup, to name a few.

- **Directory Services:** Ability for users to access a directory of users rather than remember each individual directory number. External directory services can also be referenced.

- **Call Admission Control:** A mechanism that can control which users or devices can call other users or devices. Call Admission Control (CAC) can also be used to allow access to external resources to certain users, such as access to conferencing capabilities.

- **Call Routing Control:** How calls are routed to services outside the call-processing device. These services could be voicemail, contact center tools, other call-processing devices within the organization, or gateways to other types of networks such as Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), SIP service providers, or the internet.

- **Bandwidth Control**: A feature that controls how much bandwidth a call is allowed to use. This can be set per call and controlled per link. For example, calls between site one and site two cannot exceed a set limit.


## Collaboration Protocols

Cisco Collaboration uses a number of protocols for communication.

![[Pasted image 20241103131627.png]]

- **SIP:** SIP is a protocol for the registration of devices and the initiation, management, and termination of real-time sessions, such as voice and video, over IP networks. SIP was developed by the IETF. SIP is becoming the default standard for voice and video.

- **H.323:** H.323 is also a protocol for the registration of devices and the initiation, management, and termination of real-time sessions. H.323 is an older standard developed by the ITU based on the H.320 standard used for video conferencing over ISDN networks.

- **SCCP:** Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP) is a Cisco proprietary protocol for the registration of devices and the initiation, management, and termination of real-time sessions.

- **MGCP:** Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) used by Cisco Unified Communications Manager to control remote gateways.

Connectivity between Cisco devices generally uses the SIP protocol. Cisco phones can also use SCCP, but any third-party phones and Cisco TelePresence devices all use SIP. Cisco Expressway supports both H.323 and SIP endpoints. Connections between Cisco Unified Communications Manager and voice gateways can use SIP, H.323, or MGCP.

## Call Signaling and Media Flow

![[Pasted image 20241103131742.png]]

Cisco Unified Communications Manager uses different signaling protocols to communicate with Cisco IP phones for call setup and maintenance tasks, including SIP and SCCP. After the call setup is finished, media exchange normally occurs directly between Cisco IP phones using Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) to carry the audio and potentially video stream.

In the figure, User A on IP phone A (left device) wants to make a call to IP phone B (right device). User A enters the number of User B. In this scenario, dialed digits are sent to Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco Unified CM), which performs its main function of call processing. Cisco Unified Communications Manager finds the IP address of the destination and determines where to route the call.

Using SCCP or SIP, Cisco Unified Communications Manager checks the current status of the called party phone. If Cisco Unified Communications Manager is ready to accept the call, it sends the called party details and signals, via ringback, to the calling party to indicate that the destination is ringing.

When User B accepts the call, the RTP media path opens between the two devices. User A and User B may now begin a conversation.

Cisco IP phones require no further communication with Cisco Unified Communications Manager until either User A or User B invokes a feature, such as a call transfer, call conferencing or call termination.

## Cisco Unified Communications Manager

![[Pasted image 20241103132246.png]]

Cisco Unified Communications Manager is the core call-processing platform for most on-premises customers and offers the largest number of features.

- **Call processing:** Call processing refers to the complete process of routing, originating, and terminating calls, including any billing and statistical collection processes.

- **Signaling and device control:** Cisco Unified Communications Manager sets up all the signaling connections between call endpoints and directs devices such as phones, gateways, and conference bridges to establish and tear down streaming connections.

- **Dial plan administration:** The dial plan is a set of configurable lists that Cisco Unified Communications Manager uses to determine call routing. Cisco Unified Communications Manager provides the ability to create scalable dial plans for users.

- **Phone feature administration:** Cisco Unified Communications Manager extends services such as hold, transfer, forward, conference, speed dial, last number redial, Call Park, and other features to IP phones and gateways.

- **Directory services:** Cisco Unified Communications Manager uses its own database to store user information. You can authenticate users either locally or against an external directory. You can provision users by directory synchronization. With directory synchronization, you can automatically add users from the directory to the local database.

- **Programming interface to external applications:** Cisco Unified Communications Manager provides a programming interface to external applications such as Cisco IP Communicator, Cisco Unified IP IVR, Cisco Personal Assistant, and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Attendant Console.

- **Bandwidth Control:** Bandwidth per call and between locations is controlled using Regions and Locations.

## Cisco Expressway Call Control

Cisco Expressway can be used as a call control platform. Cisco Expressway also provides call processing and bandwidth management capabilities, but these are not as comprehensive as those provided by Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Cisco Expressway's main strengths are its ability to interwork seamlessly between different devices using different protocols and its role along with Cisco Unified Communications Manager to provide edge services. Since Expressway was traditionally a video call-processing platform, it still has a number of video-centric capabilities that customers who do not use Cisco Unified Communications Manager as a phone system can make full use of.

## Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express

Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express is essentially a call-processing software component that runs on Cisco Routers. Cisco Unified CME is positioned more towards smaller businesses and smaller offices of larger businesses.
