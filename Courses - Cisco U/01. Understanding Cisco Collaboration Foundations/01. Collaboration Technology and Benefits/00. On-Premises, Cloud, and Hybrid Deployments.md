# On-Premises, Cloud, and Hybrid Deployments

## Collaboration Deployment Models: On-Premises

More and more customers are moving IT services to the cloud, and collaboration is no different. Collaboration applications and services may be delivered solely on-premises, solely in the cloud, or more commonly in a combination known as a hybrid deployment.

On-premises deployments are where collaboration applications are deployed within the enterprise premises to provide voice and video calling; text, voice, and video messaging; presence; and video conferencing and desk, screen, and content sharing.

## Collaboration Deployment Models: Cloud

In the case of cloud deployments, collaboration services delivered from the cloud include voice and video calling, messaging, and meetings with video, as well as content and screen sharing. Webex is a cloud-based service used for delivering these services. In a cloud deployment, end-user devices such as phones and telepresence systems are still located on the customer site.

Additional cloud implementations of collaboration can include collaboration platform-based services as provided by third-party managed service providers and integrators that deliver traditional on-premises collaboration applications and services from the cloud. Cisco Hosted Collaboration Solution (HCS) is an example of this type of cloud platform-based service.

## Collaboration Deployment Models: Hybrid

In cases where enterprises desire the benefits of both on-premises services (such as existing investment, high-quality voice and video calling, and so on) and cloud services (such as continuous delivery or mobile and web delivery), those enterprises are most often implementing hybrid deployments with a combination of both on-premises and cloud-based collaboration applications and services.
