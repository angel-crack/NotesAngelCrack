Cisco Unity Connection is the Cisco voicemail platform. As well as supporting traditional voicemail recording and playback, messages can also be converted to text and sent via email. In addition, Cisco Unity Connection provides an AutoAttendant feature that allows you to route calls to people, departments and collect information using an interview call handler.

The Cisco Unified Communications Manager Instant Messaging and Presence (IM&P) server provides chat messaging and presence indicators inside Jabber for on-premises users. Presence indicators show when a person is available or not, often a green dot beside a name indicating they are available and online. In contrast, a red dot indicates they are busy.
