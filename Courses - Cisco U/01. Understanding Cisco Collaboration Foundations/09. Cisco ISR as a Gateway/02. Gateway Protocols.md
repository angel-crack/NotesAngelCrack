This topic describes the gateway protocols.

## SIP Gateways

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) gateways are independent call control systems. They exchange signaling messages with any other call control system such as Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

In a Cisco Unified Communications Manager deployment, SIP gateways exchange signaling messages with Cisco Unified Communications Manager. As shown in the figure, the voice streams are exchanged directly between the gateway and the phone.

SIP is a common standard that is based on the logic of the World Wide Web and very simple to implement. It is widely used with gateways and proxy servers within service provider networks for internal and end-customer signaling. Like other VoIP protocols, SIP is designed to address the functions of signaling and session management within a packet telephony network.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager communicates with a SIP Gateway using a SIP trunk. A SIP trunk enables SIP messages to be sent from Cisco Unified Communications Manager to another device such as a SIP gateway. The configuration of a SIP trunk includes the destination address of the remote device or devices and enables the configuration of SIP specific settings, for example security features.

Calls are routed to the SIP trunk from dial plan rules created in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Once the call arrives at the gateway, the dial plan rules on the gateway route the call to the next destination, for example the PSTN network.

Calls routed from the gateway back to Cisco Unified Communications Manager also use settings configured on the SIP trunk, and the dial plan within Cisco Unified Communications Manager routes calls to the internal destination, usually a phone or video device.

## H.323 Gateways

Like SIP gateways, H.323 gateways are also independent control systems and also require a separate dial plan configured on the gateway. Cisco Unified Communications Manager communicates with an H.323 Gateway configuration on Cisco Unified Communications Manager which points at the H.323 gateway configuration running on the router. Media is still sent directly between the phone and the gateway

## MGCP Gateways

Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) gateways operate in a different manner to SIP and H.323 gateways. MGCP allows a call control device such as Cisco Unified Communications Manager to take control of gateway configuration running on the router. In this scenario there is no local dial plan on the hardware router and the dial plan configuration is configured on Cisco Unified Communications Manager. This has the advantage of centralized gateway administration.

Using MGCP, Cisco Unified Communications Manager knows and controls the state of each individual port on the gateway. It allows complete control of the dial plan from Cisco Unified Communications Manager, and gives Cisco Unified Communications Manager per-port control of connections to the PSTN. This is implemented with the use of a series of plaintext commands sent over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 2427 between Cisco Unified Communications Manager and the gateway. Media is still sent directly between the phone and the gateway

The disadvantages of MGCP include the requirement for a local dial plan to be configured on the router to provide a backup configuration should the connection to Cisco Unified Communications Manager fail. In addition, calls currently are active when a connection between the MGCP-controlled gateway and Cisco Unified Communications Manager fails.
