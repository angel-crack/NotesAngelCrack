Cisco voice gateways are functions of Cisco ISRs. This topic will describe the various functions that a Cisco ISR can provide in a collaboration environment.

![[Pasted image 20241107185150.png]]

An ISR is a data device at its heart. Routing protocols, access lists, IP addresses, and other routing configurations are completed before the collaboration functions are activated. The 19XX, 29XX, and 39XX Series routers run the Cisco IOS system, while the 4000 Series routers run IOS XE Software. Cisco IOS XE Software is an updated version of IOS Software, which is based on an open architecture and is more secure and resilient than previous versions of IOS Software. All new Cisco hardware will eventually run IOS XE Software. The good news is that the configuration differences between IOS and IOS XE commands are small.

When using a Cisco router as a voice or video gateway, additional functions are configured on the router. These functions include:

- **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) connectivity:** Typically refers to T1 and E1 digital circuits. These telecommunications circuits use a clock reference to merge 24 to 30 voice channels on 2 pairs of wires. The most common TDM circuits in use today are primary rate interface circuits known as PRIs.
- **Analog interfaces:** While these circuits are sometime grouped with TDM type connections, they are not clock-based. The most used interfaces are Foreign Exchange Office (FXO) and Foreign Exchange Station (FXS). An FXS port allows analog phones to be added to the environment, and an FXO port allows the connection of analog trunks from another PBX or the PSTN.
- **Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express:** The router uses a combination of core programming to support IP phones and dial peers for outside the router access. Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express is a self-contained phone system capable of supporting Cisco IP phones, analog phones, and PSTN connections.
- **Survivable Remote Site Telephony****(SRST):** Uses a reduced feature set of Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express to support IP phones and PSTN interfaces in the event of a connectivity failure between a branch site and the centralized Cisco Unified Communications Manager devices.
- **Cisco Unified Border Element:** Acts as a gateway for IP-based SIP trunks. The router acts as a demarcation point for SIP connections from Cisco Unified Communications Manager to other PBXs or the PSTN. Cisco Unified Border Element can provide security, protocol interworking, and functions such as call admission control (CAC) and record keeping.
- **Digital signal processor (DSP) resources:** DSPs are special computer chips called application-specific integrated circuits. These modules, called packet voice DSP modules (PVDMs), allow a router to process Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) audio and video streams and converts them into a format required for PSTN connections such as T1/E1 PRI. DSPs also provide services such as conferencing, transcoding, and transrating of the RTP stream.

## TDM Gateway

**Multiplexing** is a technique used to send multiple lower-bandwidth signals over a high-bandwidth transmission medium. By combining these signals into a single transmission, it leverages the larger bandwidth of the medium, allowing more efficient data transfer between communicating devices.

### 1. Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM):

FDM enables multiple signals to be sent simultaneously, with each source transmitting within an assigned frequency range. A buffer, or "guard band," is placed between adjacent frequencies to prevent overlap, reducing the risk of interference and collisions. In this setup, the frequency spectrum is divided into logical channels, giving each user a designated bandwidth segment. Commonly used in radio and TV broadcasting, FDM assigns separate frequency bands to each signal to avoid interference between channels.

**Application of FDM:**

1. In the first generation of mobile phones, FDM was used.
2. The use of FDM in television broadcasting
3. FDM is used to broadcast FM and AM radio frequencies.

### **2. Time Division Multiplexing (TDM):**

TDM is suitable when the transmission rate of the medium exceeds the data rate of the sources. In TDM, each signal is assigned a specific time slot, and these slots are brief enough to make the transmissions appear concurrent. Unlike FDM, where signals operate on different frequencies, TDM transmits signals at the same frequency in separate time intervals.
 

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/fi2.png)

It is of the following types: 

**1. Synchronous TDM:**

Time slots are assigned in advance and remain fixed, even if a source has no data to transmit at its allocated time. This approach is commonly used for digitized voice multiplexing, though unused slots may reduce channel efficiency.

**2. Asynchronous (or statistical) TDM:**

Time slots are allocated dynamically based on the source's readiness, conserving channel capacity by assigning slots only when data is available.

### Advantages of Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM):

**Efficient Use of Bandwidth:** FDM allows multiple signals to be transmitted over a single communication channel, which can lead to more efficient use of available bandwidth.  
**No Time Synchronization Required:** FDM does not require precise time synchronization between the transmitting and receiving devices, making it easier to implement.  
**Low Implementation Cost:** FDM is a relatively simple technique that does not require sophisticated hardware or software, making it less expensive to implement.

### Disadvantages of Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM):

**Limited Capacity:** FDM is limited in terms of the number of signals that can be transmitted over a single communication channel, which can be a disadvantage in applications where a large number of signals need to be transmitted.  
**Interference:** FDM can be susceptible to interference from other signals transmitted on nearby frequencies, which can degrade the quality of the transmitted signals.  
**Difficulty in Assigning Frequencies:** FDM requires careful assignment of frequencies to different signals to avoid interference, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.

### Advantages of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM):

**High Capacity:** TDM can support a large number of signals over a single communication channel, making it ideal for applications where many signals need to be transmitted.  
**Simple Implementation:** TDM is a relatively simple technique that is easy to implement, making it a cost-effective solution for many applications.  
**Precise Time Synchronization:** TDM requires precise time synchronization between the transmitting and receiving devices, which can help ensure accurate transmission of signals.

### Disadvantages of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM):

**Inefficient Use of Bandwidth:** TDM may not make optimal use of available bandwidth, as time slots may be left unused if there are no signals to transmit during a particular time slot.  
**High Implementation Cost:** TDM requires sophisticated hardware or software to ensure precise time synchronization between the transmitting and receiving devices, making it more expensive to implement than FDM.  
**Vulnerable to Timing Jitter:** TDM can be vulnerable to timing jitter, which can occur when the timing of the transmitting and receiving devices drifts out of sync, leading to errors in the transmission of signals.

Since SIP trunks are not universally utilized by all customers, gateways are used to support the older TDM circuits to connect to the PSTN network. While the acronym TDM is often misused to describe all traditional telephone circuits, it is actually only applicable to digital circuits that use a high-speed clock reference to synchronize channel multiplexing between two endpoints such as a telephone service provider and the gateway.

A gateway providing TDM support has a circuit card called a voice WAN interface card (VWIC), installed in a router module to terminate the digital circuit. VWICs can support one or more digital circuits depending on the card.

The VWIC maintains the digital circuit, supports signaling, and media transmission. The RTP stream is terminated by DSP resources configured for voice termination. The output of the DSPs is in the correct format for transmission on the digital circuit. Inbound media is sent to the DSP for conversion to the RTP stream, which is sent to the endpoint receiving the call.

Primary rate interfaces (PRIs) are used on ISDNs to connect multiple voice or data channels from a customer site to the telephone network. Collaboration infrastructure uses PRI interfaces to connect a Cisco router that is providing voice services to the telephone network. PRI supports common channel signaling (CCS), which means one channel of a PRI is used for signaling.

PRIs comes in two types:

- **T1:** Used in the United States, Canada, and Japan, T1 consists of 24 channels of 64 kbps. Twenty-three channels are used to carry voice; one channel is for data.
- **E1:** Used everywhere else, E1 consists of 31 channels of 64 kbps. Thirty channels are used to carry voice, one channel is for data, and one channel is for synchronization.

ISDN also supports channel associated signaling (CAS), where signaling information is sent in the same channel as voice. Cisco Voice gateways can use CAS or CCS, but CCS is far more common.

## Analog Interfaces

![[Pasted image 20241107190757.png]]

While an enterprise may have moved away from TDM circuits, the organization may have some analog devices in their environment. The number of devices will vary depending on the country where they reside, but some systems have some analog devices that have not been converted to some other technology.

Fax machines and analog phones are common uses for analog gateways. Analog PSTN circuits are still common in smaller sites. While the industry is steadily moving toward SIP connection for all PSTN connections, support for the older circuits is still required.

Analog ports come in three varieties:

1. **Foreign Exchange Station (FXS):** FXS ports are the most common interface. A device such as a fax machine, analog phone, or paging system might connect to an FXS port.
2. **Foreign Exchange Office (FXO):** An FXO port is used primarily to connect to analog PSTN circuits but might also be used to connect to some brands of overhead paging systems.
3. **Ear and mouth (E&M):** E&M circuits are quite rare but can be used to connect to radio transmitters, paging systems and other call control devices such as a PBX. The main benefit of an E&M circuit is positive seizure and disconnect signaling. This benefit is important with endpoint equipment such as a radio or paging system where a hung connection can cause the endpoint to be unusable.

Analog port densities vary by the device providing the functionality. Since FXS ports are the most common, dedicated gateways such as VG350, VG320, VG310, VG204, and VG202 can supply 160, 48, 24, 4, and 2 ports respectively. If the site already has a voice gateway for PSTN connectivity, a VWIC can provide up to 4 FXS ports or a combination of FXS and FXO ports.

Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP), Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP), and SIP are supported signaling protocols. While SIP is recommended for most gateway signaling, SCCP and MGCP provide many more user features with FXS ports. SIP supports basic calling features, but SCCP and MGCP provide features such as call forwarding, ad hoc conferencing, redial, and speed dialing. While these features may not be required in all situations, many manufacturing companies use analog phones as their primary devices on the factory floor. In this case, the added features are desired.

SCCP- and MGCP-controlled gateways require minimal configuration before they download most of the programming from Cisco Unified Communications Manager. SIP requires dial peers in the gateway to provide the inbound and outbound dial plan.

## Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express

![[Pasted image 20241107201616.png]]

Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express is a router with all the previously mentioned features such as analog or digital ports with the additional capability of supporting Cisco IP phone registration and call processing. Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express is essentially a phone system in a router. Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express supports most models of Cisco SIP and SCCP IP phones with many of the same features as when they are connected to Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express uses a combination of IP phone configurations and dial peers to create a complete system. SIP phones are controlled by the voice register global section of the configuration and SCCP phones are controlled by telephony service.

In small installations, the IP phones can be directly connected to the router using 8-port EtherSwitch modules but, more likely, the router will connect to a full-sized Ethernet switch via an IP interface.

Traditional ports such as FXS, FXO, T1/E1 are supported.

## Survivable Remote Site Telephony

![[Pasted image 20241107201728.png]]

Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST) is a fallback call control system that resides in a branch router at a remote site. SRST features can be added to most ISR branch routers. The number of phones supported depends on the router model. The small 800 router supports 5 end points while the 4451-X can support as many as 2000 phones.

After the initial configuration of SRST, the process waits for a phone to register. In the figure, the WAN is functioning correctly. Each endpoint sends out a keepalive at 30-second intervals, by default. The keepalive travels across the WAN to its assigned Cisco Unified Communications Manager. If the keepalive is returned, the endpoint takes no action and continues to stay registered with Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

If the branch router is functioning as an MGCP-controlled PSTN gateway, the gateway function of the router also sends keepalives to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. These keepalives allow the PSTN connection to fail over to the local router at the same time as the remote endpoints.

![[Pasted image 20241107201751.png]]


When WAN connectivity is lost, the endpoints do not receive a response to their keepalive messages. The endpoints follow their programming to find alternate Cisco Unified Communications Manager devices. The last entry in the list is SRST. The phone sends a registration request to the SRST router.

The router queries the phone for information such as directory number and creates the appropriate configurations, and the phone registration is accepted by SRST. The MGCP gateway will detect the WAN failure and revert to either H.323 or SIP. Preconfigured dial peers allow the phones to use the PSTN connections while in SRST mode. The MGCP-fallback feature is not part of SRST, but it works seamlessly with it.

At some point, WAN connectivity will be re-established. The phones and the MGCP gateway are still trying to reach the Cisco Unified Communications Manager devices at the top of their lists. Every 30 seconds, each endpoint sends a keepalive to all the Cisco Unified Communications Manager devices in its configuration. Once a response is received from a Cisco Unified Communications Manager higher in the list, the phone starts a timer (default 120 seconds). The phone continues to send keepalives for the length of the timer. If all the keepalives are acknowledged, the phone will reregister to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. The intent of the delay is to try to ensure that the WAN link is stable and not flapping up and down.

The MGCP gateway can be configured with a similar delay so that the phones and gateways all return to Cisco Unified Communications Manager at roughly the same time.

## Cisco Unified Border Element

![[Pasted image 20241107202050.png]]

Until approximately 2006, the only way for an enterprise to connect its internal voice and video network to services outside the enterprise was to use TDM or serial gateways to the traditional PSTN. Starting around 2006, new voice and video service options to an enterprise became available from service providers, often as SIP trunk services.

Using a SIP trunk for connecting to PSTN and other destinations outside the enterprise involves an IP-to-IP connection at the edge of the enterprise's network. The same functions traditionally fulfilled by a TDM or serial gateway are still needed at this interconnect point including demarcation, call admission control, quality of service, troubleshooting boundary, and security checks.

For voice, Cisco Unified Border Element fulfills this function as an interconnection point between the enterprise and the service provider network. Note that Cisco Unified Border Element still runs on a Cisco ISR.

Cisco Unified Border Element provides the following functions when used with SIP trunks to another destination such as the PSTN or another PBX:

- **Session Control:** Cisco Unified Border Element is a voice gateway that allows VoIP to VoIP connections. A standard voice router does not have this ability. The router functions as a SIP or H.323 gateway for call control, bandwidth management, and so on. The router uses dial peers to make the call routing decisions.
- **Demarcation:** As with a traditional telephone circuit, there is normally a demarcation point between the customer and the service provider. Cisco Unified Border Element provides that function. Often, the Cisco Unified Border Element is provided and controlled by the service provider. Cisco Unified Border Element defines the point of customer responsibility and the network border. Cisco Unified Border Element also adapts the internal IP addressing scheme to the external Internet IP addresses.
- **Security:** Cisco Unified Border Element can add encryption capabilities, authentication to remote destinations and other security functions to the router.
- **Interworking:** Cisco Unified Border Element can provide SIP to H.323 and H.323 to SIP conversion. It can help with converting codecs, preventing certain codecs, and DTMF relay. DTMF relay send touch tones out of band from the RTP stream to avoid distortion by the compression of the RTP stream.

## Digital Signal Processors

![[Pasted image 20241107202118.png]]

Digital signal processor (DSP) chips are part of a large assembly called a Cisco Packet Voice Digital Signal Processor module (PVDM). The version of the module will be determined by the router that will receive it. Older EOL routers like the 2800 and 3800 models will use a PVDM2, 2900 and 3900 use PVDM3 or PVDM2 with an adapter, and 4000 Series routers use PVDM4 modules. Typically, the capacity of the PVDMs increase with each new model.

Traditional voice circuits such as FXS ports or T1/E1s require a way to change the incoming voice stream to an RTP stream that can be received by a VoIP endpoint. DSP resources are required to make this conversion. This process is called voice termination. In the 2900 and 3900 Series Routers, the DSP resources on the motherboard are used for FXS, FXO, E&M, and T1/E1 interfaces. A 30 channel E1 would take 30 DSP channels. T1/E1 modules for these routers can contain dedicated DSP resources. The 4000 series ISR routers use analog and digital interface cards that require their own DSP resources. FXS, FXO, and E&M cards have nonconfigurable DSPs. T1/E1 cards require PVDMs to support voice termination requirements.

The current PVDM4 modules support 32, 64, 128 or 256 channels. These modules can be installed on the motherboard of the router or on the T1/E1 modules. Larger SM-X modules, sometimes called DSP farms, start at 768 channels and go to 3080 channels.

This high number of channels would not be required for voice interfaces. DSPs provide additional functionality to the collaboration environment. These functions include:

- **Conferencing:** While Cisco Unified Communications Manager supports software conferencing, it may not have enough resources or uses too much bandwidth across WAN connections. Hardware or DSP-based conferencing can easily add capacity and can be placed in remote branch routers to provide local conferencing without the need to traverse the WAN.
- **Transcoding:** When two endpoints do not have a compatible codec, a transcoder can convert the codec in real-time to allow the endpoints to receive the media stream in its preferred codec.
- **Transrating:** Similar to transcoding but this function does not convert codecs. Transrating modifies a codec by changing its packetization rate. For example, if one device is requesting g.711 at 50 packets per second (pps) and the other endpoint is requiring g.711 at 33 pps, the endpoints would not be able to establish an RTP stream due to the incompatibility. A DSP resource can take the 50 pps stream and repacketize it as 33 pps and the reverse in the opposite direction.
- **Media termination:** Does not change codecs or packetization rates. It acts as a relay point for a media stream. By bouncing an RTP stream through a DSP resource, the DSP can provide an anchor for H.323 fast start or SIP early offer. An MTP can also provide compatibility between different types of dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) tone transmission.
