Cisco IOS gateways are used to act as demarcation points between the internal IP network and either a traditional telephony interface or another IP network. The source and destination endpoints are each represented as call legs in the router. These call legs are created based on dial peers that allow the router to make call routing and media stream configuration decisions.

![[Pasted image 20241115105943.png]]

VoIP systems, like the traditional telephony systems that came before them, are based on a hop-by-hop architecture. Systems such as Cisco Unified Communications Manager or a voice enabled router utilizes programming to point to the next part of the overall architecture. The next hop could be Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster, a Cisco Unified Border Element, or an IOS router used to terminate traditional telephony circuits.

A voice call over a packet or traditional telephony network is segmented into discrete call legs. When a gateway receives a call setup, it performs a routing decision and sends the call setup request to the next device. The incoming portion of the call is the incoming call leg and the outgoing part of the call is the outgoing call leg. You may also see the terms inbound and outbound call legs.

The direction of the call setup, incoming versus outgoing, is from the perspective of the router.

## Call Legs and Dial Peers Overview

![[Pasted image 20241115105953.png]]

Dial peers are essential to implementing dial plans and providing voice services over an IP packet network. Dial peers are used to identify call source and destination endpoints and to define the characteristics that are applied to each call leg in the call connection.

A voice call over the packet network is made up of discrete segments or call legs. A call leg is a logical connection between two routers or between a router and a telephony port. Each voice gateway establishes at least two call legs.

The incoming call leg is associated with the inbound (source) dial peer, while the outgoing call leg is associated with the outbound (destination) dial peer. Attributes that are defined in a dial peer are applied to that call leg.

The figure shows an analog phone on port 1/0/0. A plain old telephone service (POTS) dial peer is created to handle call legs to and from that phone. A second phone is connected to a router which can be reached across the IP network. A VoIP dial peer is created to handle call legs to and from that router.

Call legs are router-centric. When an inbound call arrives on a gateway, the gateway finds the inbound dial peer and processes its settings. If the settings are acceptable, the gateway finds the outbound dial peer, establishes the outgoing call leg, and the call is switched from the incoming call leg to the outgoing call leg. You need to configure dial peers to enable call routing on a gateway.

## Dial Peer Types

Dial peers are generally classified into POTS dial peers and network dial peers.

![[Pasted image 20241115110000.png]]

POTS dial peers define the characteristics of a traditional telephony network connection. The POTS dial peer maps a dial string to a specific voice port on the local gateway. Normally, the voice port connects the gateway to the local PSTN, PBX, or analog telephone.

The specific type of network dial peer used depends on the network transport technology. The VoIP dial peer is by far the most common network type. The VoIP dial peer is mapped to the IP address, Domain Name System (DNS) name, or server type of the destination VoIP device that terminates the call.

The type of dial peer and the programming options for that dial peer are controlled by the keyword applied at the end of the initial command.

``` c
Voice_router(config)# dial-peer voice number ?
    pots	Telephony
    voip	Voice over IP
```
## VoIP Dial Peer

The dial-peer parameters vary based on the dial-peer type. A VoIP dial peer can point to either an H.323 or SIP device.

![[Pasted image 20241115110009.png]]

VoIP dial peer parameters include coder-decoder (codec), quality of service (QoS), voice activity detection (VAD), dual tone multifrequency (DTMF) relay, and fax rate.

VoIP dial peers map a dial string to a remote network device. Some examples of these remote network devices are as follows:

- Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster
    
- another voice gateway
    
- SIP proxy
    
- voicemail server
    

## Use of String Matching

When configuring dial peers on a Cisco Unified Communications gateway, you can use three commands that match telephone numbers.

![[Pasted image 20241115110037.png]]

Two telephone numbers are usually sent with the call: the calling number, known in ISDN as the Automatic Number Identification (ANI), and the called number, referred to as the Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS). Both numbers can be used to find the inbound and outbound dial-peer.

The obvious usage of the `destination-pattern` command is to match the outbound dial-peer based on the called number. The command is also considered when matching the inbound dial-peer, but then the destination pattern string is matched against the calling number.

The incoming `called-number` command is only considered when selecting the inbound dial-peer. It matches the original called number.

The `answer-address` command is only considered when selecting the inbound dial-peer. It matches the original calling number.

## String-Matching Characters

The three string-matching commands, `destination-pattern`, `incoming called-number`, and `answer-address` have a string parameter. The gateway compares the received numbers with the strings defined in the respective commands.

![[Pasted image 20241115110045.png]]

The string may explicitly match the characters in the telephone numbers (0–9, *, #), and it can contain special regular expressions:

- **Plus sign (+)**: The plus sign in front of a string specifies that the string must conform to E.164. E.164 is the ITU-T recommendation for the international public telecommunication numbering plan.
    
- **Period (.)**: A period matches any single entered digit from 0 to 9, and is used as a wildcard. The wildcard can be used to specify a group of numbers that may be accessible via a single path. A pattern of “200.” allows for 10 uniquely addressed devices, while a pattern of “20..” can point to 100 devices. If one site has the numbers 2000 through 2049, and another site has the numbers 2050 through 2099, the bracket notation would be more efficient.
    
- **Brackets ([ ])**: Brackets indicate a range. A range is a sequence of characters that are enclosed in the brackets. Only single numeric characters from 0 to 9 are allowed in the range. In the previous example, the bracket notation could be used to specify exactly which range of numbers is accessible through each dial peer. For example, the first site pattern would be “20[0–4].”, and the second site pattern would be “20[5–9].”. In both cases, a period is used in the last digit position to represent any single digit from 0 to 9. The bracket notation offers much more flexibility in how numbers can be assigned.
    
- **T**: When the timer (T) character is included at the end of the destination pattern, the router collects dialed digits until the interdigit timer expires (10 seconds, by default) or until you press the number termination character (the default is #). The timer character must be an uppercase T.
    

## Note

An asterisk (*) and pound sign (#) are not considered special characters. They appear on standard touch-tone dial pads and may be used when passing a call to an automated application that requires these characters to signal the use of a special feature. For example, when a user calls an interactive voice response (IVR) system that requires a code for access, the number dialed might be “5551212888#”, which would initially dial the telephone number “5551212” and input a code of “888” followed by the pound key to terminate the IVR input query.

## Number-Matching Examples

![[Pasted image 20241115110057.png]]

The table provides examples of number matching:

| String      | Matching Telephone Numbers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5551234     | This pattern matches one telephone number exactly, 5551234. This destination pattern is typically used when there is a single device, such as a telephone or fax, connected to a voice port.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 555123[5-9] | This pattern matches the number range 5551235 to 5551239.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 55512[34].  | This destination pattern matches a 7-digit telephone number where the first 5 digits are 55512, the sixth digit can be a 3 or 4, and the last digit can be any digit. This destination pattern is used when telephone number ranges are assigned to specific sites. In this example, the destination pattern is used in a small site that does not need more than 30 numbers assigned.                                                            |
| .T          | This destination pattern matches any telephone number that has at least 1 digit and can vary in length from 1 to 32 digits. This destination pattern is used for a dial peer that services a variable-length dial plan for local, national, and international calls. It can also be used as a default destination pattern so that any calls that do not match a more specific pattern will match this pattern and can be directed to an operator. |

## Matching Inbound Dial Peers

The inbound dial peer determines the call properties for the incoming side of the call.

![[Pasted image 20241115110115.png]]

To match inbound call legs to dial peers, the router uses three elements in the call setup message and five configurable dial-peer attributes. The three call setup elements are, in the example of ISDN, as follows:

- **Called number (DNIS)**: Specifies the destination, which is derived from the ISDN setup message or channel associated signaling (CAS) DNIS.
    
- **Calling number (ANI)**: Denotes the origin, which is derived from the ISDN setup message or CAS ANI.
    
- **Voice port**: Carries the incoming call.
    
![[Pasted image 20241115110122.png]]

The gateway selects an inbound dial peer by matching the information elements in the setup message with the dial-peer attributes. The gateway matches these items in the following order:

1. **Called number with incoming called-number**: First, the gateway attempts to match the called number of the call setup request with the configured incoming called-number parameter of each dial peer. This attribute has matching priority over the answer-address and destination-pattern matching. If multiple incoming called-number attributes match the DNIS, the longest match wins.
    
2. **Calling number with answer-address**: If no match is found in Step 1, the gateway attempts to match the calling number of the call setup request with the answer-address of each dial peer. This attribute may be useful in situations where you want to match calls based on the calling number. If multiple answer-address attributes match the ANI, the longest match wins.
    
3. **Calling number with destination-pattern**: If no match is found in Step 2, the gateway attempts to match the calling number of the call setup request to the destination-pattern of each dial peer. If multiple destination-pattern attributes match the ANI, the longest match wins.
    
4. **Voice port (associated with the incoming call setup request) with the configured dial peer port parameter (applicable for inbound POTS call legs)**: If no match is found in Step 3, the gateway attempts to match the configured dial-peer port parameter to the voice port associated with the incoming call. If multiple dial peers have the same port configured, the dial peer first added in the configuration is matched.
    
5. If there is no match, the default dial peer is used but only if the device is trusted.
    

Only one condition must be met. The gateway stops searching when a dial-peer match is found.

![[Pasted image 20241115110131.png]]

The figure illustrates an example of matching inbound dial peers. When the destination gateway receives the call setup request, it looks for the inbound dial peer. The ANI is 1001; the DNIS is 2001. The `incoming called-number` command has the first precedence and exists in dial peer 3 but does not match the DNIS. The `answer-address` command has the second precedence, exists in dial peer 2, and matches the ANI. Therefore, dial peer 2 is selected as the incoming dial peer.

![[Pasted image 20241115110142.png]]

Use the `answer-address` command when matching the geographical region of the caller.

The example shows a dial peer 1. This dial peer is matched on incoming calls based on the `answer-address 511` command. Any incoming call with a caller ID starting with 511 will match this dial peer.

Dial peer 1 references a `voice translation-profile` named 511_in. This `voice translation-profile` applies voice voice translation-rule 1 to all incoming calls whose caller ID starts with 511. The `voice translation-rule` converts any destination (called number) to 6129642001. The resulting number is used to match the destination-pattern of an outbound dial peer.

This approach is recommended in these situations:

- Callers from a given country are directed to the appropriate language-speaking team.
    
- Callers from a specific region are directed to the regional sales staff.
    

Use the `incoming called-number` command whenever possible. Because all types of call setup messages and signals always include the DNIS information, Cisco recommends using the `incoming called-number` command for inbound dial peer matching. In particular, the `incoming called-number` command is useful for service selection, such as in these situations:

- Different numbers are available to reach the sales and technical support.
    
- Different numbers exist for shipping order, tracking, and cancellation.
    

## Default Dial Peer

![[Pasted image 20241115110151.png]]

The figure illustrates the situation in which the call routing works only in one direction. This scenario brings up the question about the inbound dial peers selected on both gateways.

Based on the shown configuration in R2, the router only contains an outbound dial-peer. Since there are no inbound matches, the router must fall back to the default dial peers for either POTS or VoIP.

![[Pasted image 20241115110201.png]]

If no inbound dial peer can be matched by the defined criteria, the gateway resorts to the default dial peer. The default dial peer is referred to as dial peer 0. Default dial peers are used for inbound matches only. They never match outbound calls. The characteristics of dial peer 0 cannot be changed.

Dial peer 0 for inbound VoIP peers has this configuration:

- G.729 and G.711 codecs are supported.
    
- IP precedence is set to 0.
    
- VAD is enabled.
    
- RSVP is not supported.
    
- Fax-rate service is supported.
    

Dial peer 0 for inbound POTS peers has this configuration:

- No applications
    
- No direct inward dialing
    

You cannot change the default configuration for dial peer 0. Default dial peer 0 fails to negotiate nondefault capabilities, services, and applications, such as DTMF relay or disabled VAD.

When the default dial peer is matched on an inbound POTS call leg, there is no default IVR application enabled on the port nor is direct inward dialing enabled. As a result, the user gets a dial tone and may dial digits.

Avoid using dial peer 0. Having the `incoming called-number` parameter configured correctly ensures that the dial peer is always matched with the parameters that you want when placing outbound calls through a gateway. Many problems with calling out through a Cisco IOS gateway are due to codec, VAD, and DTMF-relay misconfigurations when dial peer 0 is being matched.

## Default Digit Stripping

![[Pasted image 20241115110210.png]]

Unlike a VoIP dial peer, a POTS dial peer will strip any explicitly matched digits by default. In the example above, the number dialed matches the destination-pattern 9011T because it is an international number. By default, the 9011 is stripped off and the call then fails. Adding the 011 back on using the `prefix` command solves the problem.

Another way of preventing a digit strip is to use the `forward-digits` command.

Dialed number: 911 matches a destination-pattern 911, but the 911 would be stripped off by default. Adding the command `forward-digits 3` to the dial peer will prevent the digit strip.

## Matching Outbound Dial Peers

When a call setup request arrives on a voice gateway, the gateway uses the incoming dial string to match the destination pattern in the outbound dial peer.

![[Pasted image 20241115110217.png]]

Both dial peers—POTS and VoIP—are considered together for outbound dial peer matching. However, an incoming VoIP dial peer cannot connect to another VoIP dial peer without the Cisco Unified Border Element feature set. VoIP dial peers can connect to POTS, and POTS can connect to POTS or VoIP.

Once the outbound dial peer is found, the call setup is progressed to the next device along the path. On outbound POTS dial peers, the `port` command is used to forward the call. On outbound VoIP dial peers, the `session target` command is used to forward the call.

![[Pasted image 20241115110223.png]]

The figure illustrates an example of outbound dial peer matching. Four calls are made from the telephone with extension 1001:

- The user dials 2001. The best match is found with dial peer 4.
    
- The user dials 2002. Dial peer 1 matches that number, but the match is the least specific. Dial peer 2 matches that number and also a total of 20 numbers (2000 to 2019). Dial peer 3 matches that number and also a total of 10 numbers (2000 to 2009). Dial peer 3 yields the best match.
    
- The user dials 2011. Dial peers 1 and 2 match the number, with dial peer 2 offering the longest match.
    
- The user dials 2111. Only dial peer 1 matches.
    

## Call Processing in Voice Gateways

The figure shows an incoming call from the PSTN to Cisco Unified Communications Manager using a traditional telephone circuit. The sequence of events from the voice gateway router’s perspective are as follows:

1. The PSTN sends a notification to the gateway of an incoming call. This could be ring voltage on an analog line or a Q.931 message on a T1/E1 PRI.
    

![[Pasted image 20241115110235.png]]

2. The router must match an incoming dial peer to figure out how to handle the call. There is an ordered sequence that the router and Cisco Unified Border Element follows to match an incoming POTS dial peer.
    
    The purpose of matching the dial peer is to determine how the incoming call should be handled. Configurations such as Tool Command Language (Tcl) scripts or digit collection instructions can be applied. Once the dial peer is matched, a call leg identifier is assigned to the incoming portion of the call.
    
3. The gateway uses the dialed number (called) to match the destination-pattern of an outbound dial peer. Only destination patterns are used to match an outbound dial peer. In this example, the called number will match the destination pattern of a VOIP dial peer which points to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. An outgoing call leg identifier is created and assigned to the call.
    

![[Pasted image 20241115111219.png]]

4. The router uses the information in the outbound dial peer to send a SIP invite message to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Configurations such as codec selection, digit manipulation, and destination address are all contained in the outbound dial peer.
    

![[Pasted image 20241115111226.png]]

## Call Leg and Dial Peer Examples

The figure shows an outbound call from directory number 1001 to a PSTN phone at 511-555-1212. (These steps assume a T1/E1 PRI is being used as the PSTN circuit. The outbound signaling would be different with an analog trunk).

![[Pasted image 20241115111234.png]]

The call process is as follows:

1. Cisco Unified Communications Manager matches the dialed digits to a route pattern and routes the call to the SIP trunk pointed to the voice gateway.
    
2. Cisco Unified Communications Manager sends a SIP invite message to the voice gateway.
    
3. The router finds a match to dial peer 1. The router matches the 9 to the “dot” in the incoming called-number. Dial peer 1 tells the router that the incoming call leg will use SIP and the g.711ulaw codec.
    
4. The router assigned a call leg ID to the incoming call.
    
5. The router looks for a match to the called number of 95115551212. Dial peer 9 contains a destination pattern 9T. The 9 matches the first digit of the called number and the T wildcard matches 5115551212.
    
6. The router assigned a call leg ID to the outbound connection.
    
7. The router drops the 9 due to the default behavior of a POTS dial peer to drop any digits explicitly listed at the beginning of the destination pattern.
    
8. The router sends a Q.931 setup message to the PSTN.
    

This figure shows a call from the PSTN to directory number 1001. (These steps assume a T1/E1 PRI is being used as the PSTN circuit. The inbound signaling would be different with an analog trunk).

![[Pasted image 20241115111243.png]]

The call process is as follows:

1. The PSTN sends a Q.931 setup message to the voice gateway with the called number of 1001. The PSTN can send the full 10-digit number or can send part of the number.
    
2. The router tries to find a POTS dial peer that matches the incoming called or calling number using the search order.
    
3. Since incoming called-number is the first choice for matching, the router selects dial peer 9 POTS since it contains the element `incoming called-number`.
    
4. The router applies the `direct-inward-dial` command so that the port does not play the dial tone and will use the collected called number to match the outbound dial peer.
    
5. The router creates a call leg ID to the inbound call to the router.
    
6. The router attempts to find a match to a destination pattern for the digits 1001
    
7. The router finds destination-pattern 1… in dial peer 1 VOIP.
    
8. The router creates a call leg ID for the outbound call from the router.
    
9. Based on the dial peer configuration, the router sends a SIP invite message to Cisco Unified Communications Manager at 10.1.5.5. The router will request the g.711ulaw codec.
