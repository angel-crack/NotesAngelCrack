Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) provide the essential service of converting traditional telephony voice streams into VoIP RTP streams. DSPs also provide additional functions such as conferencing, transcoding, media optimization, and media termination points.

DSPs are integrated circuits that reside on Cisco Packet Voice Digital Processor Modules (PVDMs). PVDMs have varying capacities from 16 to 3080 channels. This density variation is due to the different numbers of DSPs on the module.

There are different versions of PVDMs which supported different ISR router series and DSP densities.

- **PVDM2:** These second-generation modules are now EOL but mentioned here as you may still come across them. The PVDM2 were intended for the older EOL 2800 and 3800 Series Routers, and they support 8 to 64 channels depending on the module. PVDM2 modules will also work on 2900 and 3900 Series Routers with an adapter.
    
- **PVDM3:** Third-generation modules designed for 2900 and 3900 Series Routers. They support between 16 and 256 channels.
    
- **PVDM4:** The latest generation PVDM will function only in 4000 Series Routers due to a form factor change. A single PVDM can be installed on the motherboard of the router or on a T1/E1 module and can support 32 to 256 channels. An enhanced services module (SM-X-PVDM) can be installed in 4331, 4351, and 4451 ISR routers. This module can support from 768 to 3080 channels.
    

## Note

The motherboard PVDM and the SM-X-PVDM can only be used to support conferencing, transcoding and media optimization. T1/E1 network interface modules (NIM) require their own PVDM for voice termination. Any extra DSP channels can be used for conferencing, transcoding and media optimization.

A DSP provides the following functions to the VoIP environment:

- **Voice termination:** This function converts traditional telephony voice streams into RTP packets and back. Each FXS, FXO, or E&M port requires one channel. Each T1/E1 port requires 24 or 30 channels respectively. Each T1 PRI requires 23 channels.
    
- **Audio conferencing:** The ability to combine the audio streams from 3 or more callers into a unified session where all the callers can hear each other. A conference can range in size from a maximum of 8 to a maximum of 64 participants, depending on the PVDM module used in the router.
    
- **Audio transcoding:** The ability to convert an audio RTP stream from one codec to another in real time. The end users are not aware of the conversion. The transcoding capacity of a specific router is a combination of the installed PVDMs and the router CPU capabilities. A smaller router will not be able to transcode as many streams as a larger model router.
    

## Note

ISR G2 routers (29XX/39XX) introduced video transcoding with Cisco Unified Border Element in IOS version 15.1(4)M. This was an experimental feature that was removed in IOS version 15.5(3)M. Video conferencing was also support for that short time. The current versions of IOS and IOS XE Software do not support video transcoding, video switching, or video conferencing.

- **Transrating** is closely related to transcoding but does not convert the codec. If two devices wish to communicate using g.711u but each is restricted to a different packetization rate, transrating can take a g.711u at 50 packets per second (pps) stream and repacketize it as g.711u at 33 pps. As with transcoding, transrating is done in real time and without the knowledge of the endpoints.
    
- **Media termination point (MTP):** MTP is a relay point for a media stream. The MTP does not change the RTP stream itself, but rather, the addressing of the packets. MTP is used for H.323 Fast Start and SIP Early Offer on outbound calls. MTPs are also used to fix dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) compatibility issues.
    

## PVDM Placement in the Network

![[Pasted image 20241115111331.png]]

The location of PVDMs in the network depends on the usage patterns of the devices in the VoIP environment. Assuming the desired codecs are g.722 within each location and g.729 between locations, the codec selection will impact other features such as conferencing.

If the remote site has the need to conference users, there are several options. If the Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers have the IP voice media streaming application enabled, software conferencing could be used but the conference would be restricted to g.711 across the WAN. If there is enough bandwidth for the required number of RTP streams, the remote devices can use conferencing at g.711. This option requires the highest amount of bandwidth between the remote site and the central site.

Another option would be to traverse the WAN at g.729 and use a transcoder in the HQ router to convert the remote RTP streams to g.711 in the central site. This option would still use bandwidth between the sites but would require only 30K per RTP stream.

The last option would be to add DSPs in the remote router and configure it as a conference bridge in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Since the DSP supports multiple codecs, this option keeps the remote site RTP streams at g.722 and any central site participants would join at g.729.

If the sites are using T1 or E1 PRIs, analog phones or trunks, the routers containing the voice interface cards will need DSP resources to convert the traditional media streams into RTP streams.

If either site has SIP trunking to the PSTN, media termination points may be required for DTMF compatibility issues or SIP early offer functions. Since MTPs are typically software only, a DSP resource may not be required.

## Voice Termination

![[Pasted image 20241115111339.png]]

Any voice interface connection to traditional circuits such as PRIs or analog devices will require voice termination support from DSPs. The DSP terminates the TDM or analog voice stream and converts it to an RTP stream and sends the packets to the destination device. The return RTP packets are received by the DSP and reformatted into the required audio stream for the non-VoIP leg of the conversation.

In older ISRs, the PVDM containing the DSPs are placed on either the motherboard or the T1/E1 interface cards. The motherboard PVDM supplies the DSP resources for voice termination on T1/E1, FXS, FXO, and E&M interface cards.

In the 4000 Series Routers, the placement of DSP changes. The FXS, FXO, and other analog interface cards come with dedicated, nonconfigurable DSP resources. The T1/E1 interface cards now require PVDM4 modules. These resources are consumed by the active T1 or E1 ports. Any remaining resources can be configured for other DSP functions such as transcoding or conferencing.

If there are not enough DSP resources for a specific interface, the connected circuit may have limited or no functionality. For example, if a PRI requires 23 DSP channels but only 12 are available, the remaining 11 channels of the PRI will not function.

## Audio Conferencing

![[Pasted image 20241115111346.png]]

Audio conferencing allows the mixing of three or more audio streams into a shared audio path. A conference can be ad hoc or meet-me (on demand). The call control entity such as Cisco Unified Communications Manager is responsible for initiating the conference call. The conferencing bridge performs the merging function.

While conferencing is available natively with Cisco Unified Communications Manager, the IP Voice Media Streaming Application service is only capable of conferencing g.711u, g.711a, and wideband codecs. It is also limited to 48 total participants per node when deployed coresident with the CallManager service. Hardware conferencing using DSP resources can be used to supplement software conferencing or replace it completely.

DSP-based conferencing can use multiple codecs and can be placed in remote locations. This feature is advantageous when trying to use WAN bandwidth as optimally as possible. Rather than having remote phone RTP streams cross the WAN to a central conferencing bridge, a Cisco Unified Communications Manager controlled conferencing bridge can be deployed in the remote ISR. Hardware conferencing can handle multiple codecs per conference, so the local devices can use the g.722 codec and a device from across the WAN can use g.729.

In the example, a phone in the remote site requests the conference resource. The local IOS conference bridge is selected by Cisco Unified Communications Manager and the conference is created. New participants are added using the codec configured in Cisco Unified Communications Manager regions configuration. This process allows most RTP streams to stay local and only one g.729 RTP stream must cross the WAN.

## Transcoding and Transrating

![[Pasted image 20241115111354.png]]

Transcoding is the conversion of an incoming RTP stream using one codec to an outgoing RTP stream using another codec. Transrating is a similar function where the codec stays the same but the packetization or packet size is changed.

Traditional transcoding is from g.711 to any other codec. A newer type of transcoding where any codec can be converted to any other codec is known as universal transcoding. Since universal transcoding involves more complicated codecs, the number of transcoding sessions per DSP will be lower than traditional transcoding.

Many deployments will not require transcoding. If a single site deployment is using a single codec, the assumption is that bandwidth will not be an issue and transcoding will not be required. Another scenario is a system that is using multiple codecs, but all endpoints and applications can use all the codecs. All endpoints can use any combination of codecs and transcoders would never be required. The final situation is when a low-bandwidth codec such as g.729 is in use across WAN connections but some devices or applications do not support g.729. In this case, the system will require transcoding to convert the g.729 codec to g.711 and back for these devices.

A transcoder is placed at the location that requires the codec modification. In the example, the third-party voicemail system can only use g.711 as its codec. The remote phones need to use g.729 across the WAN to get the most out of the WAN connection. The conversion will happen local to the g.711 only application or device since bandwidth is not an issue internally at this site.

Transcoding and transrating are closely related. Transcoding converts one codec to another codec. Transrating is changing the packet size but keeping the codec the same. For example, g.711u can be packetized at 10, 20, or 30 ms of voice or video. If a site is using 10 ms samples per packet, the device is sending 100 packets per second (pps). At 20 ms samples, the device is transmitting 50 pps and 30 ms samples sends 33 pps.

The main benefit of sending fewer packets per second is the reduction in packet headers. Each header adds 40 bytes of overhead per packet. When you decrease the packets per second, the VoIP bandwidth is reduced but the end to end delay is increased. The bandwidth consumed is reduced because there are fewer headers being sent but the packet payload is larger, so it takes longer to serialize or transmit each packet. As with many aspects of VoIP design, there are always tradeoffs. The default packetization rate for Cisco Unified Communications Manager is 50 packets per second or 20 ms samples.

## Media Termination Point

![[Pasted image 20241115111400.png]]

A Media Termination Point (MTP) is an entity that accepts two full-duplex media streams. It bridges the streams together and allows them to be set up and torn down independently. The streaming data received from the input stream on one connection is passed to the output stream on the other connection, and vice versa. MTPs have many possible uses, including:

- **Repacketization of a stream:** An MTP can be used to transcode G.711 a-law audio packets to G.711 mu-law packets and vice versa, or it can be used to bridge two connections that utilize different packetization periods (different sample sizes).
    
- **DTMF conversion:** DTMF tones are used during a call to signal to a far-end device for purposes of navigating a menu system, entering data, or other manipulation. They are processed differently than DTMF tones sent during a call setup as part of the call control. There are several methods for sending DTMF over IP, and two communicating endpoints might not support a common procedure. In these cases, Cisco Unified Communications Manager may dynamically insert an MTP in the media path to convert DTMF signals from one endpoint to the other. Unfortunately, this method does not scale because one MTP resource is required for each such call. The following sections of the course help determine the optimum amount of MTP resources required, based on the combination of endpoints, trunks, and gateways in the system.
    
- **SIP early offer support:** The default setting for outbound SIP trunks is delayed offer. In delayed offer, the IP address, port numbers, and desired codecs are not sent until the called party sends its first response to the original INVITE message. This response is normally a 200 OK message. If it is required that the media stream parameters should be sent as part of the initial INVITE message, an MTP is required to anchor the RTP stream. The media stream information is sent via Secure Device Provisioning (SDP) in the first INVITE message using the IP address and port number of the MTP and the codec of the originating device.
    
- If Cisco Unified Communications Manager determines that an MTP needs to be inserted but no MTP resources are available, it uses the setting of the service parameter **Fail call if MTP allocation fails** to decide whether to allow the call to proceed. This service parameter is set to a default value of False. With this default configuration, an incoming call on a SIP Early Offer trunk would result in an outbound Delayed Offer.
    

ISR routers can provide MTP support without the need for DSP resources on the router. This capability is accomplished by using software MTPs. Software MTPs provide all capabilities of hardware MTPs except repacketization of a stream.

A transcoder is also capable of performing the same functionality as a MTP. In cases where transcoder functionality and MTP functionality are both needed, a transcoder is allocated by the system. If MTP functionality is required, Cisco Unified Communications Manager will allocate either a transcoder or an MTP from the resource pool, and the choice of resource will be determined by the media resource groups.
