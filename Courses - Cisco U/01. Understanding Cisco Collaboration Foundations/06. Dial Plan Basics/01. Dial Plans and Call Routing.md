This topic will describe the concepts of a dial plan and how call routing works in Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

## Cisco Unified Communications Manager Call Routing Overview

In Cisco Unified Communications Manager, telephone calls are routed and interconnected based on the dialed number. This process is like IP routing. Call routing is destination-based routing.

Three major areas of call routing exist:

- Intrasite routing covers call routing within a single site.

- Intersite routing covers call routing between multiple sites.

- Public switched telephone network (PSTN) routing covers call routing between a site and the PSTN.


|Routing Type|Routing Component and Characteristics|
|---|---|
|Intrasite|Calls within a single site (on-net) calls: Uses assigned directory number to route calls internally. Directory numbers usually have a uniform length.|
|Intersite|Calls between sites: On-net: Uses internal directory numbers. Off-net: Uses route patterns to send calls to other sites through PSTN gateway; if abbreviated dialing is used, internal number must be translated to PSTN number first.|
|PSTN|Calls to PSTN (off-net): Uses route patterns to send calls to PSTN destinations.|

The Cisco Unified Communications Manager automatically routes calls to internal destinations within the same cluster because it is configured with the directory numbers of its associated devices. This type of configuration is comparable to directly connected networks at a router in IP routing.

An explicit route, called a route pattern, must be configured for external destinations including the following:

- PSTN destinations, including off-net intersite calls, which are effectively PSTN destinations because they are addressed by their PSTN number.

- Other VoIP domains, such as an Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP).

- Another Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster.


A route pattern is equivalent to static routes in an IP router.

In summary, the call routing table of Cisco Unified Communications Manager is composed of connected devices, directory numbers of registered IP phones, and statically entered route patterns that point to external destinations.

## Destinations of Call Routing Requests

The call routing table of Cisco Unified Communications Manager is composed of directory numbers and route patterns. Additional routing components can be configured and are added to the call routing table as possible call routing targets.

|Routing Component|Description|
|---|---|
|Directory Numbers|Numbers assigned to all endpoints and applications; used for internal routing within a cluster|
|Route Patterns|Used to route calls to off-net destinations (via a gateway) or to other Cisco Unified CM clusters (via a trunk)|
|Translation Patterns|Used to translate a dialed number and then look up the translated number in the call routing table again|
|Hunt Pilot|Used to route calls to hunt group members based on a distribution algorithm (longest idle, circular, and so on)|
|Call Park Numbers|Allows placing a call on hold to a number and retrieving the call from another phone by dialing the number|
|Meet-Me Numbers|Allows a conference call initiator to set up a conference call and attendees to join the conference by dialing the conference number|

All of these targets are possible call routing targets, which means that a dialed number can match one of these entries and the call is routed to the appropriate entity. The targets can be a phone line, a trunk, a gateway, a feature, or an application.

The distinction of call routing sources and call routing targets is extremely important when implementing features such as calling privileges, call classification, and others.

## Sources of Call Routing Requests

When thinking of the source of a call routing request, the simplest example is an IP phone placing a call. However, there are other routing components that can require a call routing table lookup.

|Routing Component|Description|
|---|---|
|IP Phones|The number dialed by an IP phone is looked up in the routing table.|
|Trunks|A call request received through a trunk is looked up in the routing table.|
|Gateways|A call request received from a gateway is looked up in the call routing table.|
|Translation Patterns|After a translation pattern is best matched (as a target of a call routing table lookup), the transformed number is looked up again in the call routing table. The entity that generates this lookup is the translation pattern.|
|Voicemail Ports (SCCP) or Trunks (SIP)|A voicemail system can be configured to allow calling other extensions or PSTN numbers (for example., the mobile phone of an employee). In these cases, the call routing request is received from the voicemail port or trunk of Cisco Unified CM.|

In addition to phones, calls can be received through gateways or trunks from the outside. But there are other entities that are sources of call routing requests, which are not that obvious:

- **Translation patterns**: A translation pattern is like a route pattern. It includes a pattern (the entry in the call routing table). If it is matched by the dialed number, another number (the translated number that the translation pattern configures) is looked up again in the routing table. A translation pattern therefore combines both roles in a single entity:

1. It is a call routing table target that a dialed number matches.

2. Then, the translation pattern causes a new, second lookup for the translated number.

- **Voicemail ports**: When a call has been sent to a voicemail system, the voicemail system can request that the call is transferred to another directory number, to a PSTN destination (for example, the mobile phone of a user), or to an assistant. In all these scenarios, the voicemail port is the entity that requests the call that Cisco Unified Communications Manager is routing.


## Note

The distinction between call routing sources and call routing targets is extremely important when implementing features such as calling privileges and call classification.

## Dialed Number Digit Collection

|Device|Signaling Protocol|Addressing Method|
|---|---|---|
|IP Phone|SCCP|Digit-by-digit (off-hook dialing) En bloc (on-hook dialing)|
|SIP|En bloc KPML SIP dial rules|
|Gateway|MGCP / SIP / H.323|En bloc Overlap sending and receiving (ISDN PRI only)|
|Trunks|SIP, H.323|En bloc Overlap sending and receiving|

The table shows the supported addressing methods in Cisco Unified Communications Manager for different devices.

In SIP en bloc dialing, all the digits that are dialed are sent together in a single SIP INVITE message.

- The Keypad Markup Language (KPML), allows digits to be sent one by one.


SIP dial rules are dial rules that are processed inside the SIP phone. Thus, a SIP phone can detect invalid numbers and play a reorder tone without sending any signaling messages to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. If dialed digits match an entry of a SIP dial rule, the dialed string is sent in a single INVITE message to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. If Cisco Unified Communications Manager requires more digits, KPML can be used to send the remaining digits from the SIP phone to Cisco Unified Communications Manager one by one.

Trunks and PSTN interfaces (Gateways) can be configured for overlap sending and receiving, which allows digits to be sent or received one by one over an ISDN PRI.

## Digit-by-Digit Analysis of Numbers Not Received in a Single Block

If an endpoint is sending dialed digits one by one, Cisco Unified Communications Manager immediately starts digit analysis when it receives the first digit.

In fact, digit analysis starts even before the first number is dialed. This step begins when a phone indicates an off-hook state to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Cisco Unified Communications Manager looks up a null string dialed number, which matches all available call routing tables at this point. A dialed null string can be used in a translation pattern to offer private line, automatic ringdown (PLAR) functionality.

As each additional digit is received, Cisco Unified Communications Manager can reduce the list of potential matches (for example, the entries of the call routing tables that match the digits received so far). After a single entry is matched (such as the directory number 1001 in the example) the current match is used, and the call is sent to the corresponding device.

## Note

Cisco Unified Communications Manager does not always receive dialed digits one by one. SCCP phones always send digit by digit when dialing off-hook. SIP phones can use en bloc dialing to send the whole dialed string at once or KPML to send digit by digit. If digits are received en bloc, the whole received dial string is checked against the call routing table at one time.

In countries whose national numbering plan is not easily defined with static route patterns, Cisco Unified Communications Manager can be configured for overlap sending and overlap receiving. Overlap sending means that Cisco Unified Communications Manager keeps collecting digits as they are dialed by the end users and passes them on to the PSTN as they are dialed. To enable overlap sending, check the Allow Overlap Sending check box on the Route Pattern configuration page. The route pattern only needs to include the PSTN access code (for example, "9" in North America or "0" in many European countries).

Overlap receiving means that Cisco Unified Communications Manager receives the dialed digits one by one from a PRI PSTN gateway. Cisco Unified Communications Manager then waits for completion of the dialed string before attempting to route the call to an internal destination. To enable overlap receiving, set the OverlapReceivingFlagForPRI service parameter to True.
