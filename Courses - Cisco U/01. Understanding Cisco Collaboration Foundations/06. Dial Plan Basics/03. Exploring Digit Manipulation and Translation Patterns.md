In this topic, you will be introduced to digit manipulation elements and translation patterns.

The following are some of the most common places where these manipulation elements are set:

- **External Phone Number Mask**: Route pattern, IP phones
- **Digit prefix and stripping**: Route pattern, route list, translation patterns
- **Transformation Masks**: Route pattern, route list, translation patterns.
- **Significant digits**: Trunks, Gateways
- **Transformation Patterns**: Use is usually restricted by partitions (assigned to the Transformation Pattern) and calling search spaces (assigned to the device under Calling or Called Party Transformations section)
- **Incoming called-party and calling-party settings**: Trunks, gateways
 

## Digit Manipulation Elements

|Digit Manipulation Element|Characteristics|
|---|---|
|External Phone Number Mask|Designates a PSTN address for the user extension—part of Calling/Called Transformation settings|
|Digit prefix and stripping|Prefixes or strips dialed digits from a route or translation pattern for outbound calls—part of Calling/Called Transformation settings|
|Transformation masks|Manipulates the dialed digits or calling-party number—part of Calling/Called Transformation settings|
|Significant digits|Strips off digits received by Cisco Unified Communications Manager for incoming calls from a PSTN gateway or from a trunk|
|Called- and calling-party transformation pattern|Applies calling- and called-number transformations for inbound or outbound calls; can be applied to various configuration elements such as device pools, gateways, trunks, and so on.|
|Incoming called- and calling-party settings|Modifies the calling number of incoming PSTN calls, based on ISDN type information; includes prefixes, digit stripping, and transformation pattern|

The figure shows the main elements of digit manipulation configuration and their characteristics.

## Digit Manipulation: Outbound Calls to PSTN

Digit manipulation can take place in several different places depending on the design and the desired outcome.

In the example, an internal user is making an outbound call and the following digit manipulations occur:

1. The user dials 9 for an outside line, followed by the number 408-971-7272.

2. The route pattern 9.408[2-9]XXXXXX is matched. However, the first digit is not required by the PSTN because it is used internally for the user to receive an outside dial tone. In the route pattern configuration, a discard digits instruction (DDI) is configured as PreDot. This configuration will drop the digits before the dot (period).

3. An external phone number mask is then applied. This mask can be configured either on the route pattern or on the line under the IP phone settings. The external phone number mask in this example is 408555XXXX. The “X’s” are used as wildcards to keep the existing digits where the “X’s” occur. The user extension is 11001; because 4 “X’s” are used, the last 4 digits are maintained as 1001. 408555 is prepended to the number, resulting in a calling number of 408-555-1001.

## Digit Manipulation: Inbound Calls from PSTN

This example show a few of the digit manipulations that can occur for an inbound call from the PSTN.

1. An outside client dials 408-555-1001. The PSTN routes the call to the on-premises gateway, which forwards the call to Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

2. Cisco Unified Communications Manager has a translation pattern configured to match the dialed number 408555XXXX. This translation pattern changes the called and calling numbers.

—The called-party transform mask of 1XXXX is similar in use to the External Phone Number Mask you saw in the previous example in that the “X’s” are used to keep existing digits in the number. In this case 1001 is kept, while the rest of the digits (408555) are discarded. The final change is to add a “1” to the front of the number making the final result 11001, which is the internal extension of the user.

—The calling-party transformation is to prefix the digit 9 to the calling number to show the full number with the company required “9 for outside line” when showing the calling number on the IP phone display. This transformation also allows for the called person (11001 in this case) to call back the number from the received calls list or missed calls list on the IP phone. Without adding the 9, these options would not work.
