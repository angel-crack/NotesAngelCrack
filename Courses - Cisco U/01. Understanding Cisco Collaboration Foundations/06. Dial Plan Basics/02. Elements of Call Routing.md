This topic will describe the elements that allow optimal path selection for call routing.

## Path Selection

![[Pasted image 20241105191635.png]]

In the figure, if a user dials a PSTN number such as 9 408 971-7272, the call is sent over the IP WAN, such as over a SIP or H.323 trunk. If this path does not work (because of network failure, no response from the other side, or so on) the call uses the local PSTN gateway as a backup and is sent through the PSTN.

For such off-net calls, route patterns must be configured in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Assuming that the office in the HQ (destination office) has a Direct Inward Dial (DID) range of 7000 to 7999, the route pattern needed from the remote site would be 9.4089717XXX. In this example, the 9 is used as a PSTN access code, 408 is the area code, 971 is the office code, and 7XXX stands for station codes 7000 to 7999.

## Note

Usually, digit manipulation must be performed depending on the selected path. In the example, for the PSTN call, the access code 9 must be removed and the calling-party number should be changed from the internal extension 1001 to a complete PSTN number. If the call is sent over the IP WAN, a different dial string than the PSTN number might be used to address the destination.

## Path Selection: Configuration Elements

![[Pasted image 20241105191657.png]]

The following are the configuration elements that are used to select the path for a given route pattern:

- **Route patterns**: Route patterns are strings of digits and wildcards, such as 9.4089717XXX, that are configured in Cisco Unified Communications Manager and are part of the call routing table. If the call routing logic matches the route pattern, it can point to one of the following:

1. Device (such as a trunk or a gateway)

2. Route list

- **Route lists**: Route lists provide the first level of path selection if multiple paths exist to reach the called number that matched the route pattern. Route lists include a prioritized list of route groups and allow digit manipulation to be configured per route group.

- **Route groups**: Route groups provide the second level of path selection. Route groups point to devices, which are selected based on one of the following distribution algorithms:

1. **Circular**: Using the circular algorithm, also known as round robin, the route group remembers the previous call and the device that it went to. Then for the current call, the route group starts hunting for a device starting below the previous device.

2. **Top down**: Using the top-down algorithm, the route group always starts at the top of an ordered list and hunts through the route group devices. This process occurs the same way for each call.


It is highly recommended to use the complete route pattern, route list, and route group construct because it provides the greatest flexibility for call routing, digit manipulation, route redundancy, and future dial plan growth. If route patterns point directly to devices, the configuration might need to be changed later when additional devices are added. Also, note that a single device cannot be used in both ways—as a member of a route group and being referenced directly from a route pattern.

## Note

Route patterns and translation patterns can be configured to block the pattern. Patterns that are blocked prevent calls to the blocked pattern on a cluster wide basis. If certain destinations should be blocked depending on the calling device or user, calling privileges must be configured.

## Route Groups

A route group is a list of devices (gateways and trunks).

A route group is a list of devices that share the same requirements for digit manipulation (for example, multiple PSTN gateways).

![[Pasted image 20241105191708.png]]


When you put devices into the route group that have identical digit-manipulation requirements, digit manipulation can then be configured once per route group during route-list configuration.

A route group can be configured for circular distribution (round robin) or for top-down distribution (first entry of the list has the highest priority). The circular distribution is used for load-sharing scenarios; the top-down distribution is used to implement backup paths if the preferred path is unavailable.

## Route List

A route list is a list of prioritized route groups. When configuring a route list, you can set up digit manipulation per route group within the route list.

A route list is a **prioritized** list of route groups.

![[Pasted image 20241105191716.png]]

In the example, two route groups have been added to the route list. Route group WAN is listed first and therefore has highest priority. If calls cannot be set up by using any device of the WAN route group, the next route group (PSTN) is used. Again, Cisco Unified Communications Manager tries all devices in that route group, according to the route-group distribution algorithm (circular or top down). A route list can be disabled, which means that it remains in the configuration database but is not used.

At the bottom of the Route List Configuration page, in the Route List Details field, you can configure route list details per route group. You can configure digit manipulation for each route group that is a member of the route list.

## Local Route Group

A local route group specifies a special route group that serves as a placeholder in route lists that need a local route group, but that do not need to bind that route group to any specific provisioned route group statically.

![[Pasted image 20241105191725.png]]


The local route group feature helps reduce the complexity and maintenance efforts of provisioning in a centralized Cisco Unified Communications Manager deployment that uses many locations with their own gateways.

The fundamental breakthrough in the local route group feature is decoupling the location of a PSTN gateway from the route patterns that are used to access the gateway.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager supports a special local route group that can be bound to a provisioned route group differently based on the local route group device pool setting of the originating device.

Devices, such as IP phones from different locations, can therefore use identical route lists and route patterns, but Cisco Unified Communications Manager selects the correct gateways for their local end via the device pool.

The reserved name, **Standard Local Route Group**, identifies a local route group in configuration windows. The binding of a provisioned local route group to the local route group occurs dynamically during call setup. The information in the device pool, to which the originating device (such as a phone or trunk) belongs, provides the basis for this binding.

With local route group mapping, Cisco Unified Communications Manager can treat gateways more like a service:

- Customers benefit because efforts related to provisioning and maintaining route plans are reduced.

- You can reduce the provisioning of route patterns and route lists from configuring N route patterns and N route lists to a configuration that requires only one route pattern and one route list.


## Route Pattern: Commonly Used Wildcards

Route patterns can include wildcards, so one route pattern can represent multiple numbers. This ability helps to keep the call-routing table short and easy to interpret, like route aggregation in IP routing.

The table lists and describes the wildcards that can be used with route patterns.

|Wildcard|Description|
|---|---|
|X|Single digit (0–9, *, #)|
|@|NANP (North American Numbering Plan)|
|!|One or more digits (0–9)|
|[x-z]|Generic range notation|
|[^x-z]|Exclusion range notation|
|#|Terminates interdigit timeout|
|<wildcard>?|Matches zero or more occurrences of any digit that matches the wildcard|
|<wildcard>+|Matches one or more occurrences of any digit that matches the wildcard|
|\+|Matches the + sign as part of a number; used for globalized E.164 call routing|
|**.**|Not a wildcard but a . is used to separate a pattern into two parts|

In Cisco Unified Communications Manager, the default interdigit timeout is 15,000ms (15 seconds), allowing for users to press the next digit before Cisco Unified Communications Manager starts to route the call. This timeout, however, also creates a 15 second delay when the user has completed dialing as Cisco Unified Communications Manager has no way of knowing the user has completed the number as required. There are two options to solve this problem:

- Reduce the T302 timer for the Cisco CallManager service under service parameters. This timer, however, cannot be reduced too low or the users won’t have sufficient time to dial the numbers as needed.

- Create a duplicate Route Pattern with # at the end of the pattern. This option allows users to either dial the number and wait the interdigit timeout or press the # key when they have completed the number to notify Cisco Unified Communications Manager that they have completed dialing and processing can commence.

## Route Pattern Examples

The table shows examples of route patterns and the dialed strings that each pattern matches.

|Pattern|Result|
|---|---|
|1234|Matches 1234|
|121X|Matches numbers from 1210 to 1219|
|12XX|Matches numbers from 1200 to 1299|
|13[25-8]6|Matches 1326, 1356, 1366, 1376, 1386|
|13[^3-9]6|Matches 1306, 1316, 1326, 13*6, 13#6|
|13!#|Matches any number that begins with 13, is followed by one or more digits, and ends with #; for example, 135# and 13579#|
|\+!|Matches any phone number that starts with + and is followed by one or more digits, as used by E.164 numbers|
|1*1X|Matches dialed digits from 1*10 to 1*19|

Note that the asterisk in 1*1X is not a wildcard, but rather a dialed digit.

Because the # symbol in pattern 13!# is used in the route pattern, it must be dialed. Otherwise, the pattern is not matched. Therefore, for users to dial 13 followed by one or more digits, without pressing the # at the end, and simply wait for the interdigit timeout to expire, an additional route pattern 13! is required.

E.164 is an ITU-T recommendation that defines the international public telecommunication numbering plan that is used in PSTN and some other data networks. E.164 also defines the format of telephone numbers. E.164 numbers can have a maximum of 15 digits, and international phone numbers are usually written with a plus sign (+) before the phone number, to represent the international call prefix. To actually dial such numbers from a normal fixed-line phone, the appropriate international call prefix must be used. Every country has both a country calling code, which is used to dial into the country, and an international call prefix (or international access code), which is used to dial out of the country. The ITU approved 00 as the general prefix standard some time ago, and many (though not all) countries have implemented this standard. For example, North American Numbering Plan (NANP) countries (including the United States and Canada), dial 011.

## Route Pattern

The figure is an example of a Local 10-digit route pattern for North America.

![[Pasted image 20241105191746.png]]


A user would dial 9 for an outside line, followed by 408[2-9]XXXXXX

This Route Pattern* would then match the HQ SIP ROUTE LIST and has been set to route the call. The number could also be blocked to prevent users dialing high-cost numbers.

Lastly the Call Classification* is set as an OffNet call as the numbers are not internal to the company.
