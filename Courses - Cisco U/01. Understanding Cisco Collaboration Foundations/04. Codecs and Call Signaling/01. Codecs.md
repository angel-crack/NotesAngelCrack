This topic will cover the methods used to convert human speech into digital packets that are compressed by using codecs.

## Analog and Digital

The human ear and voice communicate using sound waves, which are analog signals. Modern communication networks communicate using digital signals. Before data can be sent from one phone to another, the data has to be converted into digital. At the receiving end, the digital signal is converted back to analog so that the receiving party can understand the message.

A digital format is used to transmit signals because any signal will degrade over distance. First, digital signals can degrade a lot further and still be readable; you can still tell a "1" from a "0." Second, when an analog signal degrades, then the signal is amplified at regular intervals, but amplification does not get rid of any unwanted noise that was picked up along the way. A digital signal is not amplified. It is recreated, which removes all the noise and creates a clean signal again. Noise created during transmission is analog in nature, so you can distinguish it from a digital signal but not an analog signal.

## Converting Analog to Digital

The first three steps of the analog to digital conversion describe the pulse code modulation (PCM) process, which corresponds to the G.711 codec. Step 4 explains compression that is performed by low-bandwidth codecs, such as G.729, G.728, G.726, or Internet Low Bitrate Codec (iLBC).

1. **Sample the analog signal regularly:** The sampling rate must be twice the highest frequency to produce playback that does not appear either choppy or too smooth. The sampling rate used in telephony is 8000 samples per second (8 kHz), which reflects the fact that the bulk of human voice energy is carried in the spectrum of 0–4 kHz.
    
2. **Quantize the sample:** Quantization consists of a scale made up of 8 major segments. Each segment is subdivided into 16 intervals. The segments are not equally spaced but are actually finest near the origin. Intervals are equal within the segments but different when they are compared between the segments. Finer graduations at the origin result in less distortion for low-level tones.
    
3. **Encode the value into an 8-bit digital form:** Encoding maps a value derived from the quantization to an 8-bit number (octet).
    
4. **(Optional) Compress the samples to reduce bandwidth:** Signal compression is used to reduce the bandwidth usage per call.
    

## Sampling

Sampling is a process that takes readings of the waveform amplitude at regular intervals by a process called pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). The output is a series of pulses that approximate the analog waveform. For this output to have an acceptable level of quality for the signal to be reconstructed, the sampling rate must be rapid enough.

Harry Nyquist developed a mathematical proof about the rate at which a waveform can be sampled and the information that can be recovered from those samples. The Nyquist theorem states that when a signal is instantaneously sampled at the transmitter in regular intervals and has a rate of at least twice the highest channel frequency, the samples will contain sufficient information to allow an accurate reconstruction of the signal at the receiver.

While the human ear can sense sounds from 20 to 20,000 Hz, speech encompasses sounds from about 200 to 9000 Hz. The telephone channel was designed to operate at frequencies of 300 to 4000 Hz. This economical range offers enough fidelity for voice communications, although higher frequency tones are not transmitted. The removal of higher frequencies leads to issues with sounds such as “s” or “th.” The voice frequency of 4000 Hz requires 8000 samples per second; that is, one sample every 125 microseconds.

|Nomenclature|Sampling Rate|Useable Bandwidth|
|---|---|---|
|Narrowband|8 kHz|200 to 3400 Hz|
|Wideband|16 kHz|50 to 7000 Hz|
|Super wideband|32 kHz|50 to 14,000 Hz|
|Fullband|44.1 kHz and up|20 to 20,000 Hz|

Nyquist theorem specifies that the significant articulation range of human voice is between of 300 – 4000 Hz. This range is the range that telephones were designed to sample and the range that VoIP was initially designed to sample to match that of traditional telephony. This range is also known as Narrowband. Although this range works well with human speech, it still does not sample the full human speech range and does not work well for music, which is a concern when using MOH (Music on Hold).

Over time new codecs have been developed, and higher sampling rates have been included to allow for crisper, more precise speech transmission. Codecs offering sampling in the full band range are suitable for live music performances.

## Quantization

![[Pasted image 20241104172312 1.png]]

Quantization divides the range of amplitude values that are present in an analog signal sample into a set of discrete steps that is closest in value to the original analog signal. Quantization matches a PAM signal to a segmented scale. The scale measures the amplitude (height) of the PAM signal and assigns an integer number to define that amplitude.

The figure shows quantization. In the example, the x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the voltage value (PAM). The voltage range is divided into 16 segments (0 to 7 positive and 0 to 7 negative). Starting with segment 0, each segment is twice the length of the preceding one, which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and makes the segment uniform. This segmentation also corresponds closely to the logarithmic behavior of the human ear. The two principal schemes for generating these samples in electronic communication are a-law and mu-law.

The a-law and mu-law standards are audio compression schemes defined by ITU-T G.711 that compress 16-bit linear PCM data down to 8 bits of logarithmic data. The a-law standard is primarily used in Europe and the rest of the world. The mu-law standard is used in North America and Japan.

Although a-law and mu-law are very similar, there are a few differences that make them incompatible. An international connection must use a-law. The mu-law to a-law conversion is the responsibility of the mu-law country.

## Encoding

![[Pasted image 20241104172320 1.png]]

Encoding converts an integer base-10 number to a binary number. The output of encoding is a binary expression in which each bit is either a 1 (pulse) or a 0 (no pulse). After PAM samples an input analog voice signal, the next step is to encode these samples in preparation for transmission over a telephony network. This process is called PCM.

The PCM process mathematically converts the value obtained from PAM sampling to another binary value within the range –127 to +127. The first bit represents positive (1) or negative (0), while the remaining 7 bits form the number between 0 to 127.

It is during this conversion where a-law and mu-law differ in their algorithms. A-law would represent the number +127 as 11111111 where the first bit is 1 (positive), and the remaining bits equal 127. Mu-law inverts the last 7 bits, which results in +127 been represented as 10000000.

It is at this stage that companding, the process of first compressing an analog signal at the source and then expanding this signal back to its original size when it reaches its destination, is applied. This whole process is generally referred to as PCM coding. A digital signal processor (DSP), which is a specialized chip, performs the PCM process quickly.

## Codec Compression

|Codec|Payload Bandwidth [kbps]|
|---|---|
|G.711|64|
|G.722|48/56/64|
|iLBC|15.2, 13.3|
|G.729|8|
|Opus|6-510|

Uncompressed digital speech signals are sampled at a rate of 8000 samples per second, with each sample consisting of 8 bits. Therefore, you have 64 kbps per call (8000 * 8). Multiple algorithms have been developed to allow voice transmission at lower bandwidth consumption. The most common coder-decoder (codec) algorithms are presented in the table in the figure, together with their bandwidth usage. Codecs offer compression to voice, much like .zip or .rar offer compression to files.
