There are many different protocols and methods for call setup and teardown; however, they all have a few fundamental steps in common. This overview will cover the steps during call setup and teardown that are not specific to any protocol.

- **Initiating the call:** After the user has lifted the handset and received a dial tone, they will dial the called party's number. These digits are sent to the call control device.
    
- **Endpoint Discovery:** The call control device then needs to identify the location of the called party. This endpoint could be registered locally on the same device, or it might require call routing configuration in order to route the a call to a remote destination.
    
- **Permission Check:** A permission check may be performed to confirm the calling party has sufficient rights to dial the number in question.
    
- **Bandwidth Check:** The call control agent may check to determine if there is sufficient bandwidth on the network to allow the call. The bandwidth check is better known as Call Admission Control (CAC). There are many options for the implementation of CAC, each with its own requirements.
    
- **Call progress tones:** After the called party endpoint is ringing, a call progress tone needs to be sent back to the calling party, which will then play the ringing tone to the user. Similarly, if the called party is engaged, the engaged tone will be played to the calling party. These are just two examples of call progress tones that are available during call setup and teardown.

- **Call answered:** After the called party answers the call, call progress tones are no longer needed.
    
- **Call Detail Record (CDR):** The call control agent can be configured to log all call information. The logging can be done through several different technologies such as syslog, RADIUS, or direct database entries. The method used for logging will largely depend on the type of call control agent that is used.
    
- **Codec negotiation:** A capabilities exchange is now required in order to find a common supported and requested codec between the two endpoints.

- **Negotiating the streams:** The two endpoints will then negotiate the ports to be used to establish the bidirectional connections for RTP and Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP).
    
    1. RTP will also use an even-numbered port between the range 16,384 – 32,767.
        
    2. RTCP will use the RTP port plus one in order to form a paired connection, which results in RTCP always using an odd port number.

- **Hang up:** When either the calling or called party terminates the call by hanging up the endpoint, signaling is sent to the call control agent to tear down the call and release the resources used.
    
- **Close connection:** Signaling between the call control agent and the called party is sent to notify and acknowledge the termination of the call and the release of the resources.
    
- **CDR:** Call details records are closed to mark the completion of the call.
    
- **Bandwidth release:** The bandwidth that may have been allocated to the call through CAC gets released in order to make resources available for future calls.
