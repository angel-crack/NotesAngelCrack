This topic will compare the different media streams found at the application layer, namely RTP, Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP), and RTCP.

After signaling has been completed, the media stream is formed directly between the two endpoints. This can either be done with RTP in an unsecured manner, meaning that the traffic is not encrypted, or the traffic can be secured using SRTP.

In either scenario, RTCP is used and set up as a separate stream in order to control the media stream.

## Real-Time Transport Protocol

Since packets are required to be sent continuously and constantly due to the real-time nature of the traffic, a different protocol is required when compared to data traffic. RTP provides end-to-end delivery for real-time data such as voice and video. Unlike traditional data, which uses acknowledgments for each packet to confirm delivery, real-time information cannot afford the delay associated with acknowledgments.

RTP runs on an even port number randomly selected from the UDP port range 16,384 – 32,767. Even though UDP is used as the underlying protocol and does not use acknowledgments, RTP adds sequence numbering in order to make sure packets are in the correct order.

RTP also includes the following:

- **Payload type:** this is used to identify the codec type and media format. This allows for codecs to change during the transmission.
- **Sequence numbering:** as already noted, this allows for packets to be sorted into the correct order, but it also allows to identify if packet loss has occurred.
- **Time stamp:** this allows the protocol to measure delay and jitter and allows the protocol to space the packets correctly on the receiving end using a playout buffer. This is to ensure packets are timed correctly and played back at the correct speed. This also assists the protocol to remove jitter caused by variations in delay experienced during transmission.

## Real-Time Transport Control Protocol

RTCP is set up as a separate stream from the RTP or SRTP stream. This is set up on the port number selected by RTP+1, which means it will always run on an odd port number.

RTCP provides out-of-band statistics and control information and includes the following:

- **Packet count:** How many packets have been used since the start of the call in both directions.
- **Packet delay:** The delay between packets since the last RTCP packet.
- **Octet count:** Bandwidth usage used during the call represented in octets (8 bits).
- **Packet loss:** Total amount of packets lost.
- **Jitter:** The variation in delay between packets.

SRTP allows for the authentication and encryption of voice and video traffic. As encrypting the RTP header would introduce routing issues for the calls, the header can be validated and authenticated but not encrypted. The RTP payload, which contains the voice and video traffic, can be encrypted as well as authenticated allowing for the secure transmission and antireplay of the conversations.
