## SIP Call Setup

![[Pasted image 20241107083853.png]]

This figure depicts the call setup between two SIP endpoints. The process is detailed in the following steps:

1. User dials 2000.
    
2. The phone sends a SIP Invite message to the Call Control containing the phone's capable codecs inside the message; this is called a Session Description Protocol (SDP) message.
    
3. The call control device reads the SIP invite and SDP message before routing the message to the receiving phone.
    
4. The call control device also sends a 100 Trying message back to the originating phone followed by a 180 Ringing message.
    
5. Afterthe user answers the call, the receiving phone sends a 200 OK message to the call control containing the receiving phone's SDP message.
    
6. The call control device reads the SDP message and sends the 200 OK message to the dialing endpoint.
    
7. An acknowledgement (ACK) message is sent from the dialing endpoint via the call control device to the receiving endpoint.
    
8. RTP media streams with corresponding RTCP streams (not shown on the figure) are established directly between the phones.
    

## SIP Call Teardown

This figure depicts the call teardown between two SIP endpoints. The process is detailed in the following steps:

1. The user hangs up the call
    
2. The phone sends a SIP BYE message to the call control device
    
3. The call control device reads the SIP BYE message then sends it onto the other endpoint in the call
    
4. The second endpoint terminates the call then responds with a 200 OK message to the call control device, which is then forwarded to the initial phone.
    

## Session Description Protocol

SIP leverages a number of other standards-based protocols to provide a large set of features based on relatively simple mechanisms. One of the relevant protocols is the SDP.

The SDP is an IETF-based format for describing streaming media initialization parameters in an ASCII string. SDP is intended for describing multimedia communication sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session invitation, and parameter negotiation. SDP does not deliver media itself but is used for negotiation between endpoints of media type, format, and all associated properties. The set of properties and parameters are often called a session profile. SDP is designed to be extensible to support new media types and formats.

This figure presents two SDP examples, and the table explains the parameters that are used in these two examples as follows:

- **Version:** Protocol version.
    
- **Origin:** Describes the sender of the message and may include one or more of these parameters: username, session ID, address type, and the address value.
    
- **Times:** Optionally defines the session start and end time stamps. The values are not set when a call setup is signaled.
    
- **Connection data:** Provides the parameters for media endpoint termination: network type ("IN" is defined as "Internet," and other types may be added), address type (IPv4/v6), and the connection address (IP address)
    
- **Media:** Specifies the media type (audio/video), the UDP transport port, and one or more media formats. Examples of Audio Video Profile (AVP) codes are:
    
    1. 0 (G.711 mu-law)
        
    2. 8 (G.711 a-law)
        
    3. 3 (Global System for Mobile Communications [GSM] codec)
        
    4. 18 (G.729)
        

## Note

The list is ordered according to the priority. SDP content varies depending on the message type.

## Offer Types

In a Delayed Offer, the session initiator does not send its capabilities in the initial invite but waits for the called device to send its capabilities first (for example, the list of codecs that are supported by the called device, thus allowing the calling device to choose the codec to be used for the session).

## Delayed Offer

There are two ways to exchange the SDP Offer and Answer messages. These methods are commonly known as Delayed Offers and Early Offers. In the simplest terms, an initial SIP Invite that is sent with SDP in the message body defines an Early Offer, whereas an initial SIP Invite without SDP in the message body defines a Delayed Offer.

The Delayed Offer is recommended for SIP trunks because it enables the Internet telephony service provider (ITSPs) to provide their capabilities first. Cisco Unified Communications Manager allows the administrator to select the offer method. Cisco gateways support both methods but originating gateways default to Early Offer.

## Early Offer

In an Early Offer, the session initiator (calling device) sends its capabilities (including supported codecs) in the SDP contained in the initial Invite. This method allows the called device to choose its preferred codec for the session. Early Offer is the default method that is used by a Cisco voice gateway acting as the originating gateway.
