This topic describes the settings menus available from the web interface and touch panel, including IP settings.

## Changing the Settings from the Touch Panel

![[Pasted image 20241115095902.png]]

The touch panel (room video endpoints) or main screen (desktop video endpoints) can be used to change some video endpoint settings, including setting up an initial IP configuration. To access the settings menu, tap the video endpoint name in the top-left corner. From there, you can enter the main settings menu as well as power off the video endpoint. Desktop video endpoints may also have call forwarding options available.

The options available in the main settings menu depends upon whether your video endpoint is already registered and, if so, what the video endpoint is registered to. In the example above, the desktop video endpoint is registered to Cisco Unified CM. From the main settings menu, you can do the following:

- **About this device:** Find out information about your device, including IP address, SIP information, MAC address, serial number, and software version.
    
- **Issues and diagnostics:** See any warnings about your video endpoint (a red dot with a number indicates warnings are present) and set logging levels.
    
- **Bluetooth:** Because this is a desktop video endpoint, Bluetooth headsets are supported and configured here.
    
- **Ringtone and volume:** Change your ringtone and the ringtone volume.
    
- **Device activation:** Change your video endpoint registration. Options include Cisco Webex cloud services, Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco TelePresence, or Cisco Unified Communications Manager via Expressway. A wizard will take you through the settings required for each option.
    
- **Network Connection:** Configure a network connection.
    
- **Restart:** Restarts the device.
    
- **Factory Reset:** Resets the device. Before doing this, make sure you have all the information you need to register the device again, because all this information will be deleted.
    

## Configuring IP Settings from the Touch Panel

Cisco TelePresence video endpoints are set to DHCP by default. If you have DHCP running on your network, you do not need to modify the IP settings manually. However, if you want your video endpoint to have a fixed IP address or do not have DHCP, you will need to configure the IP address manually. You can set a manual IP address from the touch panel or using the CLI via the serial port.

From the touch panel, navigate to the settings menu and select **Network Connection** from the menu.

From this screen, you can review your network connections and, in this case, you can see that DHCP is enabled and an IP address of 192.168.1.122 has been assigned.

Click the Ethernet connection to modify the settings.

From this menu, you can disable DHCP, which will then allow manual IP settings to be entered. You can also disable IPv4 and enable IPv6 from this menu.

Once you click into an editable field, a keyboard will appear to enable you to enter IP information. You can scroll up and down by moving your finger up and down on the screen. After you have made all the changes, you can tap the check icon in the top right corner of the screen to save the changes. When changes have not been made, the check icon is a light grey.

## Changing Settings from the Web Interface

The web interface for any Cisco TelePresence video endpoint is accessible using the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) from any web browser with network reachability to the video endpoint. The default username is admin and there is no password set.

After you have signed in, the Home page is displayed. From the Home page, you can locate the video endpoint information, any warnings, and the registration status. The image below shows SIP and WebEx registrations for this device.

Which settings are available to change will depend on where your video endpoint is registered. Click **Setup > Configuration** to view the settings menu.

## Changing the IP Settings from the Web Interface

To change the IP address of the video endpoint, click **Setup > Configuration**,then **Network** from the menu on the left side.

Modify the network settings as required and click **Save**. Note that the Save button does not appear until a change has been made.

## Adding Option and Release Keys to a Video Endpoint

You can add option and release keys to a video endpoint using the web interface or CLI. Option keys enable optional features such as Remote Monitoring (enables the video in the room to be visible from the web interface) and multisite (enables 4-way embedded SIP/H.323 conferencing). Multisite is not available on every model endpoint. For exact specifications for any video endpoint, see the specific datasheet for that model.

A product key may be required to upgrade to the next major version of software.

From the web interface home page, navigate to **Maintenance > Option Keys** or **Maintenance > Product Key**

![[Pasted image 20241115100011.png]]

Enter the option key, as shown in the figure. Option keys are obtained from your Cisco partner. Enter the option key as shown in the figure below.

A product key (sometimes called a release key) will also need to be obtained from your Cisco partner. Enter the product key as shown in the figure.
