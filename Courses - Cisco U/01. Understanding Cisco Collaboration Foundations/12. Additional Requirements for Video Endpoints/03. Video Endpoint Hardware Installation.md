This topic looks at the video endpoint installation requirements, including the component parts and documentation.

## Component Parts of a Cisco TelePresence Video Endpoint

The component parts of a Cisco TelePresence video endpoint include speaker, microphone, screen, camera, codec, something to control the video endpoint with, network, and power. All video endpoints will have these component parts, which can be fully built into a single unit or be separate component parts.

Codec stands for coder-decoder and is the "brains" of the system, where all the inputs from the cameras and microphones are processed and coded before sending, and the information received is decoded and processed before sending to the speaker and the screen.

Larger room video endpoints use a touch panel that is connected separately and, usually, table microphones that provide high audio quality when participants are sitting further from the Cisco TelePresence video endpoint than they would be in a desktop environment.

## Physical Installation Guidelines

Every Cisco TelePresence video endpoint has an installation guide detailing the installation of the specific video endpoint. You should read the relevant installation guide before attempting an installation.

The installation guide will tell you what is in the box as well as extras you can order. All Cisco TelePresence video endpoints come with all the cables needed for basic operation. Power connectors are supplied to match the region where the device will be installed.

The Touch 10 can be connected directly to the codec or via the network as long as they are in the same subnet. Power to the Touch 10 can be connected directly or, if using the network option, power can be provided by Power over Ethernet (PoE).
