This topic will describe the operation of the Cisco TelePresence video endpoints.

## Controlling Cisco TelePresence Video Endpoints

![[Pasted image 20241115095324.png]]

Controlling the Cisco TelePresence video endpoint can be done via the web GUI, CLI, remote control, touch panel, or on-screen controls. All devices have the web GUI and CLI interface, but the remote control, touch panel, or on-screen control is device-dependent.

The actual options available on a video endpoint will depend on the video endpoint type and the platform to which the video endpoint is registered.

## Video Endpoint Basic Operation

When video endpoints are not in use, their default behavior is to turn off the screen. If the screen is blank or shows a faded picture like the image on the left in the figure, you can tap the touch panel to wake the video endpoint. On desktop video endpoints, you will need to tap the actual screen. If you have Webex Teams installed on a mobile device with you when you enter a meeting room, the video endpoint may automatically wake up.

![[Pasted image 20241115095342.png]]

When awake, the main screen shows as on the right in the figure. The video endpoint will show the main controls at the bottom of the screen. You will have a call button but other options will depend on the video endpoint type. The figure shows a Cisco Unified Communications Manager registered desktop video endpoint and therefore has buttons for messaging and extension mobility. On a conference room video endpoint, you will likely see a sharing button for content sharing instead, providing that a sharing source is connected.

From the home screen, you can access the following:

1. Top left
    
    - **Settings menu:** Tap the name at the top left of the touch panel to access the Settings menu.
        
    - Top right
        
        - **Speaker/headset:** In an on-desktop video endpoint that supports headsets, you can use the headset/speaker icon to switch between the internal speakers or connected headset. Headsets can be connected using USB or Bluetooth.
            
        - **Camera controls:** If your video endpoint has a moveable camera or multiple cameras, the camera control icon will be present.
            
        - **Self view:** Shows your local camera view.
            
2. Bottom center
    
    - Call button plus optional controls, depending on the video endpoint.
        

## Making and Receiving Calls

Tap the Call button to enter the call menus.

You can make calls using these methods:

- **Manually:** Dial the number or Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URI using the keyboard. The keyboard appears automatically when you press the Call button.
    
- **Favorites menu:** These are locally stored numbers. After a call has been made to a site, then you can add the dialed number to the favorites menu using the ‘Mark as favorite’ option from the Recent or Directory list.
    
- **Recents:** Redial a recent call made from the video endpoint.
    
- **Directory:** Corporate directory entries managed from a central source. You cannot edit the corporate directory from the video endpoint but you can edit the call options before you place the call by pressing and holding on the entry. You can also save a directory entry as a favorite, which in turn can be edited.
    
- **One**-**Button-to-Push****(OBTP):** If your call is a scheduled meeting, you may see the meeting listed on the touch panel and the main screen, in which case, you can tap the **Join** button next to the meeting to join the call.
    

![[Pasted image 20241115095403.png]]

To end a call, click the **End Call** button at the bottom of the screen. On a desktop video endpoint, the buttons are on the same screen as the video, so they will disappear from view. Tap the screen again, and the buttons will reappear.

![[Pasted image 20241115095429.png]]

Incoming calls can be answered or rejected from the touch panel (room video endpoints) or main screen (desktop video endpoints).

## In-Call Menus

![[Pasted image 20241115095436.png]]

During a call, the options that are available will depend on the number of participants and the type of video endpoint. These options are available:

1. Top right
    
    - **Camera control:** Ability to pan, tilt, or zoom in a camera, select and save a preset camera position, turn speaker tracking on or off, and turn self-view on and off.
        
    - **Layout control:** Visible when Sharing is active or there are more than two participants in a call. Enables the layout of the local screen or screens to be arranged as desired.
        
    - **Participants list:** Provides a list of who is in the conference. You can also hang up participants from this list in some scenarios, depending on how a multiparty conference has been hosted.
        
2. Bottom
    
    - **Turn off video:** Turns off video.
        
    - **Add:** Enables adding a participant.
        
    - **Share:** Usually used to share a computer screen. The computer must be connected using a cable, proximity, or Webex Teams before it can be shared. Other content-sharing options may be available.
        
    - **Hold:** Places the call on hold.
        
    - **Keypad:** Brings up a keyboard that can be used to send DTMF tones to either input information (like a Webex Meetings ID) or control some functions in certain calls. For example, *6 can be used to unmute your microphone in a Webex meeting.
        
    - **Transfer:** Transfers a call to another device.
        
    - **End Call:** Ends the call.
        

## Content Sharing

The video system supports the ability to show presentations in a video call. Sharing content is as simple as connecting your source device and tapping **Share**, then tapping Share in call.

![[Pasted image 20241115095448.png]]

## Note

Your video endpoint may have been configured to let one of the video input connectors of your video endpoint share HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) protected content, allowing you to watch video through Google Chromecast, Apple TV, an HDTV decoder, and so on. This feature is available for outside calls only. If you attempt to share content through this specific video connector while in a call, no content sharing will take place. Instead, the part of the screen normally allocated to content sharing will turn black in order to maintain the HDCP regime. This will apply to any content that you attempt to share in a call via this input connector—whether protected by HDCP or not protected.

## Binary Floor Control Protocol

Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) is a standard for managing floor control during collaboration sessions across dedicated video endpoints, mobile devices, and personal computers running collaboration software. These capabilities can be delivered using an enabled Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) standards-based video endpoint or as a software implementation in a collaboration application stack.

![[Pasted image 20241115095458.png]]

The basic concept of floor control is analogous to managing a live in-person presentation, where you want to control who is presenting, manage and transition your presenters, and maintain a feedback loop. Also important is the ability to allow a presenter to show slides and share with your audience a white board or transparency projector.

BFCP provides the ability to manage multiple streams being presented during a collaboration session using floor control. BFCP accomplishes this management using a token-based mechanism where a single presenter can request control of the floor from the floor-control server.

When this request is granted, the presenter holds the token and has the ability to open an additional stream to provide presentation data. This same interaction can also take place during a point-to-point audio or video call with only two parties. In this case, a token can be used to signify which party will be presenting an additional stream, such as a secondary camera or application providing a desktop sharing session. One of the critical differences here is that in a point-to-point call, the floor-control server capability is being provided by the user device or application instead of using a multipoint control unit or conference server.

BFCP is a signaling protocol—agnostic, in that it is relying on the capabilities of the underlying signaling and transport protocols to set up each stream that is being managed, including whether voice, video, or content is being provided in the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) stream.

Besides BFCP, other standardization efforts around conference role and content management also were defined, including the ITU-T H.239 recommendation. Unlike BFCP, H.239 applies specifically to H.323-enabled ISDN and IP conferencing video endpoints, whereas BFCP is agnostic of the underlying signaling protocol.

## Proximity: Screen Sharing

The Intelligent Proximity feature allows you to share content from a video endpoint wirelessly on your own device (smart phone, iPad, Android tablet, PC, or Mac). You can also use your own device (smart phones and tablets only) to control calls on the video endpoint.

![[Pasted image 20241115095510.png]]

You will need to download (free of charge) the Cisco Intelligent Proximity app from the App Store or Google Play. Windows or OS X users, go to https://proximity.cisco.com/. Your video support team may not have activated any of the features, all of them, or just a subset of them. Intelligent Proximity makes use of ultrasound when connecting users. Do not block the microphone of your computer, smart phone, or tablet. Intelligent Proximity has been designed not to work outside the meeting room when doors to the room are kept closed. You will need to be close to the video endpoint to use the feature. When privacy dictates, always keep the meeting room entrance doors closed to avoid possible eavesdropping from adjacent rooms.

If your source device has Intelligent Proximity enabled, just switch on Proximity on your device, let your device pair with the video endpoint and you will be able to share content wirelessly.

## Cisco Webex Teams Integration

![[Pasted image 20241115095520.png]]

If you are running the Cisco Webex Teams application on your phone or laptop, you can connect directly to a Cisco Webex Teams registered video endpoint using the Cisco Webex Teams app.

1. From the Teams app, click **Connect to a Device**
    
2. Select the video endpoint from the list.
    
3. Enter the code that appears on the video endpoint screen.
    
4. Click **Share Screen**.
    

## Far-End Camera Control

![[Pasted image 20241115095534.png]]

You might be in a video call in which one or more of the other video endpoints have a remotely controllable camera. Referred to as far-end camera control (FECC), you will then be able to control those cameras from your own video endpoint. If the far-end video endpoint has activated camera tracking, (which takes place when the camera tracks and shows who is speaking), you will _not_ be offered the option of FECC. You do not have access to any remote camera presets.

## Speaker Tracking

![[Pasted image 20241115095542.png]]

Video endpoints equipped with a speaker-tracking camera system use the camera image together with a built-in microphone array to track speakers within the room. The video endpoint will track and show the person speaking so that you will not have to use the Camera Control menu or Camera Presets to zoom in and out. When Speaker Tracking is activated, the camera position presets will not be available. You must turn off Speaker Tracking to have access to the presets.

## Note

Speaker Tracking will not work if the microphones are muted. Speaker Tracking can be expanded to include the Snap to Whiteboard and Presenter Tracking features.

## ActiveControl

The ActiveControl feature allows conference participants to administer a conference from an video endpoint by using the video endpoint interface (not available from the TRC5 remote control and on-screen display).

![[Pasted image 20241115095557.png]]

With ActiveControl, users can see a list of participants and other information during a conference. On certain video endpoints, they can change the conference layout displayed locally, and disconnect other participants. ActiveControl is available for conferences hosted on TelePresence Server bridges that are running in remotely managed operation mode. In Optimized Conferencing deployments, ActiveControl is available for rendezvous/personal Collaboration Meeting Room, ad hoc, and Multiway conferences that are hosted on TelePresence Server bridges, but is not available for scheduled conferencing, including Webex Enabled TelePresence meetings.

ActiveControl allows the sending of the following meeting information:

- Participant list (also known as the roster list) so that you can see the names of the other people in the call and the total number of participants
    
- Indicator of audio activity for the currently speaking participant
    
- Indicator of which participant is currently presenting
    
- Indicators telling whether the meeting is being recorded or streamed, and if there are any nonsecure video endpoints in the call
    

ActiveControl also supports these administrative tasks:

- Select the layout to be used for the video endpoint.
    
- Disconnect other participants in the meeting.
