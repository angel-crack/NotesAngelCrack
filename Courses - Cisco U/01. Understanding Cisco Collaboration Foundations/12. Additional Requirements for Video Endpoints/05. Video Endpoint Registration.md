This topic describes the registration process for video endpoints that are registering to either Cisco Unified Communications Manager or Cisco Webex.

## Cisco Unified Communications Manager Settings

The boot process of a Cisco TelePresence video endpoint is similar to a phone.

![[Pasted image 20241115100227.png]]

1. The TelePresence video endpoint obtains IP settings and a TFTP server address from the DHCP server. IP settings and TFTP server settings can be configured manually.
    
2. The TelePresence video endpoint downloads configuration files from the TFTP server. The main configuration file is called SEPmac-address.cnf.xml.
    
3. If the firmware version on the video endpoint is not the same as the firmware listed in the configuration file, the video endpoint will download and install software from Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
    
4. The video endpoint will register to Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
    

Setting up the Cisco Telepresence video endpoint on Cisco Unified Communications Manager is similar to a phone. All Cisco TelePresence video endpoints register to Cisco Unified Communications Manager as SIP video endpoints. All settings are the same as a SIP-based phone and include the MAC address, SIP profile, and SIP security profile. The only other setting that you may want to set is the web access so that the web interface of the video endpoint remains available.

1. Navigate to **Device > Phone** and select the endpoint type from the list and click **Next**.

2. Enter the **MAC Address**, **Device Pool**, and **Phone Button Template.** These settings are required but you can use optional settings as required.
    
3. For a room system, set the **Owner** to **Anonymous.** For a personal system, set the **Owner** to **User** and add the **Owner User ID**.

4. In the Protocol section, set the **Device Security Profile**.
    
5. Set the SIP profile to the **Standard SIP Profile for TelePresence Endpoint**.
    
6. In order to maintain access to the web and SSH interfaces, set both of these values to **Enabled**.

7. Add a number and URI in the same way you add these to a phone.

## Video Endpoint Settings for Cisco Unified Communications Manager Registration

On the video endpoint, you have three options:

- Use the wizard that appears on the video endpoint when it is first turned on.
    
- Use the web interface to change the Provisioning settings
    
- Use the CLI to change the Provisioning settings
    

You will need to use the on-screen wizard or CLI if you do not have DHCP because the web interface requires that an IP address be configured and reachable.

**Using the Wizard on the Video Endpoint**

- If the video endpoint has already been registered elsewhere, perform a factory reset first (**Settings > Factory Reset**). When rebooted, the registration wizard will appear on the touch panel or main screen, depending on the endpoint type.

2. Press the **Start** button
    
3. Confirm that the network settings are correct and make any changes necessary.
4.

4. Press the **Other services** option
    
5. Press the **Cisco UCM** option. In this example, assume that you are inside the company network. If you were outside the company network—at home, for example—you would select the **Cisco UCM via Expressway** option. You will then need your username, password, and domain information to register.

6. Enter in the TFTP Server address. You can use the IP address or the FQDN.
    
7. The video endpoint will download the configuration files and register to Cisco Unified Communications Manager and the setup will be complete. If your software is not the same as the software version required, your video endpoint might go through a software upgrade and a reboot before registering.

## Web Interface Configuration

Web Interface Configuration

1. Factory reset the video endpoint if this installation is not new.
    
    1. Navigate to **Maintenance > System Recovery > Factory Reset**.
        
    2. Click **Perform a factory reset**.
        
![[Pasted image 20241115100352.png]]

2. From the web interface, navigate to **Setup > Configuration** and choose **Provisioning** from the left-side menu.
    
3. Set the Mode to **CUCM**.
    
4. If your TFTP server address is not provided by the DHCP server using option 150, then enter the TFTP server address in the External Manager Address field and save.

## Cisco Webex Control Hub Settings

If you are registering video endpoints to the Cisco Webex cloud, you need to add the endpoint using the Cisco Webex Control Hub.

1. Browse to **admin.webex.com** and log in.
    
2. Navigate to **Devices** on the left side.
    
3. Click **Add Device**.
    

![[Pasted image 20241115100422.png]]

4. If you are setting up a personal video endpoint or phone, click **Existing User**, or if you are setting up a room endpoint, click **Workspace**. This example uses Workspace.
    
5. Click **Existing Workspace** if you have already set up a workspace or **New Workspace** if you need to set up a new workspace. In this example, Existing Workspace is used, and the name Paris is entered in the box indicated in the figure. If you had chosen Existing User in the previous step, you would be asked for the username.

6. You will need the activation code entered into the video endpoint. You can print, copy, or email from this page.

## Video Endpoint Settings for Cisco Webex Registration

If the video endpoint has been factory reset or is a new installation, the wizard will appear on the screen or Touch 10 on bootup.

1. Press **Start**.
    
2. Confirm that the network settings are correct and make any changes necessary.
    
3. On the Choose a Call Service screen, press **Cisco Webex**.
    
4. Enter the activation key and click the blue arrow in the top right corner.
    
5. When registered, your video endpoint might download software and reboot.
