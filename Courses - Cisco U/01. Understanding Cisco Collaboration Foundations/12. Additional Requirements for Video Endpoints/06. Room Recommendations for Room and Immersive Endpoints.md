This topic will describe the room requirements and recommendations to get the best experience when using room and immersive video systems.

## Room Design

Immersive Cisco TelePresence considers the entire room environment and it is a good idea to create a familiar, consistent experience for all rooms. In other words, Immersive Cisco TelePresence matches the experiences of local and remote participants using similar room design.

Specifically, the elements in Immersive Cisco TelePresence room design are:

- Lighting
    
- Acoustics
    
- Aesthetics
    

When these elements are consistent, there is continuity. The more continuity there is between multiple environments, the more immersive the experience will feel. Remember that the idea is to make the local room and remote room as similar in their core design elements as possible. When successful, the meeting participants will feel like they are in similar rooms sharing the same experience.

If two totally different rooms, in different countries, and different time zones, have continuity, the meeting participants will focus on the meeting rather than the technology or room. This experience is the ultimate goal of Immersive Cisco TelePresence. When designing a Cisco TelePresence environment, regardless of the size of the endpoint, one should always consider the environment of the endpoint and if the environment supports the elements of continuity.

## Lighting

The main purpose of lighting is to provide the required illumination for the picture to be processed correctly by the camera.

![[Pasted image 20241115100657.png]]

The lighting must provide an accurate depiction of objects in the scene, including their spatial relationship by showing depth within the scene. To accomplish this task, it is critical to control the intensity, color, and distribution of lighting so that it produces well-defined, high-quality images. Appropriate lighting is generally achieved by the use of three-point lighting, with a key light, a fill light, and a back light. The three-point lighting method illuminates the subject, provides shape, and separates the subject from the background.

**Key Light**

In a film studio, the key light is the main light used to illuminate the subject. Often, since this light is twice as bright as any other lighting, it creates hard shadows and contrast. It is also the most important light on the set because it provides the source of light from which the camera is calibrated, as well as the other lighting on the set. The key light is generally not positioned at an angle low enough to illuminate the subject’s face and creates shadows over the subject's eyes, creating a "raccoon-like" effect. If the shadows are not illuminated by a fill light (discussed below), the whites of the eyes are also lost along with any possibility of eye contact.

In Immersive Cisco TelePresence, the key light is achieved by the standard commercial ceiling fixtures already installed in the environment or additional fixtures that are added to the ceiling. However, the use of direct-lighting fixtures increases the shadowing effects. Since reduction of this effect for better eye contact is desired, Cisco highly recommends replacing direct-lighting fixtures, if present, with indirect fixtures that balance light throughout the room and soften shadows.

**Fill Light**

Fill lighting is generally a reflected light within the studio or set that softens shadows and fills dark areas on the subject being filmed. Fill lighting is also referred to as ambient light or global illumination. Without adequate fill light, shadows appear as solid black on camera due to the camera's limited dynamic range. Adequate fill light is imperative to avoid shadows. With an Immersive Cisco TelePresence endpoint, the fill light is provided by the endpoint. The main difference between the Cisco TelePresence endpoint-integrated lighting and a traditional production fill light is that Cisco TelePresence participants must be illuminated without eyestrain for long durations, versus the very bright lighting used for traditional fill lights. To accomplish the appropriate lighting, Cisco has developed light sources that are at an extremely low angle, allowing the light to illuminate facial features with a softer and lower intensity than traditional production style fill lights.

**Back Light**

To help the subject stand out from the background and promote the perception of depth, back lighting is used. Back lighting is performed in two primary ways. First, a light is cast onto the back of the subject, illuminating its outer edge or contour. This lighting gives the subject a sharp edge that is clearly brighter than the background and allows the subject to stand out. This type of lighting is called a rim light because it places a rim of light on the subject. Second, to provide additional separation of the subject from background, the background itself is lighted with less intensity than the subject in the foreground (sometimes this technique is referred to as the fourth light). It is also lit with subtle patterns or angles to provide reference points of focus for the camera, and ultimately the human eye, to perceive the separation of space and depth within the scene.

## Lighting Sources

**Facial Lighting**

Point the light meter sensor at the camera from where the subject will be sitting or standing. This position accurately identifies how much light is on the subject from the cameras’ perspective. If the subject is a person, the light meter sensor is held to the persons face, perpendicular to the floor and pointed towards the camera. This type of measurement is commonly used in video production lighting and measures the vertical plane lighting. For Immersive Cisco TelePresence, facial lighting should be 200 to 400 lux on the vertical plane at the participants’ faces (about 1.2 m up from a finished floor). This measurement should not include the approximately 100 lux provided by the Immersive Cisco TelePresence endpoint’s integrated lighting. In other words, this measurement should be taken with the Cisco TelePresence endpoint off.

**Shoulder Lighting**

For Immersive Cisco TelePresence, shoulder lighting should not exceed twice the value of the facial lighting. This measurement should also be taken with the Cisco TelePresence endpoint off.

## Note

This topic limits its discussion to fluorescent lighting fixtures because these are the most commonly available commercial lighting fixtures. LED lighting technology continues to make significant progress and there are now a number of commercially available LED fixtures. Unfortunately, there are not a large number of LED lighting fixtures that can easily produce the required illumination for Immersive Cisco TelePresence.

![[Pasted image 20241115100719.png]]

**Indirect Lighting**

The physical design for illumination in an Immersive Cisco TelePresence room can be simple or elaborate as long as the technical specifications are met. Cisco highly recommends indirect linear lighting fixtures as the primary source of illumination for a Cisco TelePresence room. This type of fixture is very common and has the ability to evenly distribute light that is both comfortable for participants and well suited for video.

Also, it is important to ensure that the selected fixtures do not produce direct lamp glare. All fixtures have a lamp shield or reflector that disperses light from the lamp source, and ensure that no meeting participant has a direct view of the lamp within the fixture.

## Acoustics

Acoustics also play a major role in continuity and Immersive Cisco TelePresence room design. Sound quality can vary dramatically depending on environmental factors such as the size of the room, hard surfaces in a room, and ambient and outside noise. Microphone placement and the location of the speaker in relation to the microphone also affect sound quality.

![[Pasted image 20241115100729.png]]

Imagine being in a Cisco TelePresence conference and the other TelePresence participants all have similar, high-quality rooms with good acoustics. Now a cell phone participant is conferenced in. Instantly there is a loss of continuity in the meeting. The Cisco TelePresence meeting participants can all still hear and understand each other, but the cell phone participant is distant, cutting in and out and talking over background noise with overall bad audio quality. You do not even have to see the participant to notice the loss of continuity. Therefore, when designing a room, consider its acoustic features. If one room is very quiet and subdued, with acoustic panels on the wall, make sure that other rooms have a similar sound quality. Alternatively, if the sound quality in one room is bright and lively, adjust the other rooms to that sound quality.

## Acoustics: Reverb

When sound waves are generated in an enclosed environment, they continue to reflect from surface to surface until the energy is completely absorbed. As the sound reflects within the environment, it will be audible for a period and eventually fall off to a point that it becomes inaudible or silent. This reflection of sound is called reverberation.

![[Pasted image 20241115100740.png]]

Reverberation is measured as _the rate of time for sound to decay by 60 decibels_ (RT60). Measuring RT60 requires the generation of enough sound waves (usually pink noise or chirps) to fill an environment and then a pause in the sound generation. At the pause, the rate at which the sound decays by 60 dB describes the RT60. This measurement is very effective in predicting the sound quality of an environment. Ideal conditions for human speech intelligibility are an RT60 value of 300 to 500 milliseconds for all frequencies between 125 Hz and 4 kHz. An extreme in either direction—too much reverberation or too little—can be detrimental to speech intelligibility, and since Cisco TelePresence is generally located in a meeting room in which the human voice is the main source of audio, an ideal sound-quality design preserves the human range of frequencies and isolates this range from interruptions.

## Acoustics: Echo

Reverberation and echo are different phenomena. Echo is defined similarly to reverberation with one important difference: echo occurs only when the reflection of sound reaches the same location as the original source of the sound.

![[Pasted image 20241115100749.png]]

Generally, reverberation is more of a concern for participants in the room while echo is more of a concern for the participants on the other side of the Immersive Cisco TelePresence meeting.

System echo is generally caused when a loud sound from the speaker has a prolonged RT60 value that is ultimately reflected to the microphone, returning it to the original source. The echo cancellation within the Cisco TelePresence codec is specifically designed to eliminate this effect; however, a buildup of reflections or a sustained reflection of sound may occasionally last longer than the threshold of the echo cancellation. This effect is rare and requires very high levels of reverberation, coupled with a very loud sound source such as yelling for longer than 30 seconds. System echo occurs most often in environments with glass walls or large windows.

## Acoustics: Sound Transmission Through Walls

![[Pasted image 20241115100757.png]]

The intensity or amplitude of sound is measured in terms of sound pressure level (SPL), an acoustic scale independent of frequency and expressed in decibels (dB), where 0 dB is the threshold of human hearing. SPL can also be described as a logarithmic measurement of the root mean square (RMS), or average power, pressure of a particular sound relative to silence at 0 dB. Cisco focuses on dB SPL for room assessment and remediation.

The sound transmission class (STC) is a single-number rating of a construction material’s ability to prevent the transmission of sound waves. Specifically, STC describes how much a sound will be diminished as it travels through the material at each of the following frequencies: 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz. For example, if a wall has an STC of 40, then a sound that is 60 dB will diminish to 20 dB by the time it transfers from one room to the next.

## Acoustics: Paneling for Noise Reduction

Usually, you need to double the existing material to increase the STC rating by 5. Therefore, acoustic materials such as sound barriers and acoustic paneling are better means of improving isolation than doubling the thickness of existing walls.

![[Pasted image 20241115100806.png]]

The noise-reduction coefficient (NRC) is a single-number rating that represents the amount of sound energy that a surface will absorb. An NRC of 0 indicates no absorption, whereas an NRC of 1 indicates complete absorption of sound. NRC is generally used to rate carpeting, ceiling tile, acoustic paneling, and other treatments and sound-absorbing materials.

For a room that needs acoustic remediation, Cisco recommends using acoustic panels with an NRC rating of 0.75 or greater. This approach enables a relatively small number of panels to be used for highly efficient sound remediation.
