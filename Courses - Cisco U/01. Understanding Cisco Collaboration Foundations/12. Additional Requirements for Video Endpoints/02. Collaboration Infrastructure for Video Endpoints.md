This topic describes the role played by collaboration infrastructure, specifically for video endpoints.

Video endpoints in an on-premises solution register to Cisco Unified Communications Manager, similar to a phone. Just like different phones have different settings, so do video endpoints, but most of the important settings are the same.

Older H.323 endpoints can also register directly to Cisco Expressway-C and the Expressway will interwork calls between SIP and H.323 as required. Expressway-C can be used for SIP registration if desired, but Cisco Unified Communications Manager registration is preferred.

Cisco Expressway-C and Cisco Expressway-E handle all external calls, including the following:

- Hybrid services and video devices deployed in the cloud
    
- Business-to-business (B2B) calls to customers and partners
    
- Connectivity for registration and call control for users working outside of the office using Mobile and Remote Access (MRA)
    

In reality, all these features work in a way similar to voice calls. Note that there is no connection to the PSTN network in this figure because Cisco voice gateways do not support video.

There are three video-specific architecture components that can be added to a collaboration network:

- Cisco TelePresence Management Suite
    
- Cisco Meeting Server
    
- Cisco Meeting Management
    

## Cisco TelePresence Management Suite

Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) was developed by TANDBERG to provide a range of tools to manage video infrastructure and video endpoints. A number of these tools are no longer needed, such as endpoint backup, endpoint configuration tools, and software update tools, because Cisco Unified Communications Manager handles these capabilities. What Cisco TMS still offers is management of scheduled conferences, phone book features, and video-specific reporting tools.

## Cisco Meeting Server and Cisco Meeting Management

Cisco Meeting Server is a conferencing bridge capable of supporting both audio and video endpoints in large-scale conferences. Cisco Meeting Server supports Cisco or third-party video endpoints, a Cisco Jabber client, Cisco Meeting Server (native or via a WebRTC-compatible browser), or Skype for Business. Cisco Meeting Server can support up to 16,800 high-definition concurrent calls and up to 2600 participants in a single conference. A single server supports up to 450 participants in a single conference.

Cisco Meeting Management allows operators to monitor and control meetings, providing a thorough service for customers. Administrators can monitor all active meetings with controls, such as add, drop, or mute participants, change layouts, and start or stop recording or streaming.
