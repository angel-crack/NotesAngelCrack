[+] As we mentioned, switches forward traffic just to interfaces that are in the same vlan. So, if two switches are connected, and we define the same vlans on both switches, how do we connect each others?

[+] One solution could be to define interfaces connected in the same vlan. something like:

But here is the thing, computers connected on vlan with green color are not able to communicate between. So, the question will be, how do we allow traffic for all vlans just in the connection between switches?.

The solution will be to set the interfaces with a switchport mode Trunk. This will uses the **dot1q** protocol to tag the frames with the vlan id.

### Dot 1 Q trunks

	* When the switch forwards traffic to another switch, it tags the layer 2 Dot1Q header with the correct vlan id.
	* Then, receiving switch will only forward traffic out the ports that are in that VLAN
	* The switch removes the DOT1Q header before it send it to a host.

This is how it is tagged:
