[+] As we mentioned, switches forward traffic just to interfaces that are in the same vlan. So, if two switches are connected, and we define the same vlans on both switches, how do we connect each others?

[+] One solution could be to define interfaces connected in the same vlan. something like:

But here is the thing, computers connected on vlan with green color are not able to communicate between. So, the question will be, how do we allow traffic for all vlans just in the connection between switches?.

The solution will be to set the interfaces with a switchport mode Trunk. This will uses the **dot1q** protocol to tag the frames with the vlan id.

### Dot 1 Q trunks

	* When the switch forwards traffic to another switch, it tags the layer 2 Dot1Q header with the correct vlan id.
	* Then, receiving switch will only forward traffic out the ports that are in that VLAN
	* The switch removes the DOT1Q header before it send it to a host.

This is how it is tagged:

In order to configure we just need to run:

```powershell hl:10,11,12,13
Switch(config)#int f0/4
Switch(config-if)#sw mod tr
Switch(config-if)#
%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface FastEthernet0/4, changed state to down
%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface FastEthernet0/4, changed state to up

Switch(config-if)#do sh int f0/4 sw
Name: Fa0/4
Switchport: Enabled
Administrative Mode: trunk
Operational Mode: trunk
Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Operational Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Negotiation of Trunking: On
Access Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Voice VLAN: none
Administrative private-vlan host-association: none
Administrative private-vlan mapping: none
Administrative private-vlan trunk native VLAN: none
Administrative private-vlan trunk encapsulation: dot1q
Administrative private-vlan trunk normal VLANs: none
Administrative private-vlan trunk private VLANs: none
Operational private-vlan: none
Trunking VLANs Enabled: All
Pruning VLANs Enabled: 2-1001
Capture Mode Disabled
Capture VLANs Allowed: ALL
Protected: false
Unknown unicast blocked: disabled
Unknown multicast blocked: disabled
Appliance trust: none
Switch(config-if)#
```

The encapsulation method by default is dot1q, so, it is no needed to be defined


### Native VLAN

All untagged traffic will be assigned to the native VLAN, the default is VLAN1, however for security reasons  it is recommended to be changed, on both switched  the natieve vlan should match in order to the trunk go up.

Just select the interface and assign the vlan


```powershell
Switch(config-if)#switchport trunk native vlan 99
```
