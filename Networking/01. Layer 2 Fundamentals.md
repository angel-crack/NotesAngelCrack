This is the format for a Frame packer at layer 2, using ethernet protocol.

Mac Address â‡’ 6 Bytes = 48 bits = 12 Hex.

Dispositivos de layer 2:

[+] Hubs:

This devices, makes forward to all ports. If one device send Frames, it will forward to all ports except to the one that receives the frame.

If two devices sends frame at the same time, at the moment of forward they will be collisioning, this is know as Collision Domain, 4 PC above are in the same Collision Domain, as they 4 will have the probability of make collision. If two hubs are connected the Collision Domain gut expanded.

This topologies are known as Half Duples, they cannot send and recieve data at the same time. When a collision is deteceted the algorithm of CSMA/CD protocol is executed.

Executing this protocol decrease the probability of collisions, however bigger the network, bigger the probability of collisions.

In order to resolve this issue, a new device was invented, his name is the bridge:

[+] Bridge:

If we put a bridge in between the Hubs, we will be sengmetating the Collision Domain into two.

It does not forward automaitcally as the Hub, when it recies a frame, it stores temporarily on a Memory, so the frame get queued until it takes the decision to send it or drop it, befor send it, it always run the CSMA/CD.

But still, collision domains happens, in a less proportion, but it happens. So, the device that resolves this issue definately, is the switch, Collision Domains are fully segmentated. And connections are full duplex.

[+] Switch:

Previously it was known as multi bridge.
