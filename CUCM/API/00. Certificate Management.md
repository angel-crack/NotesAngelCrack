[+] The Certification Management API supports CUCM, IM&P, CUC, and CER products with version 14 and later.

[+] The APIs are server specific. Use the subscriber hostname for performing Certificate Management operations on the subscriber.

## How to use

[+] Authenticate, create account name, it will work for authentication:

```powershell
set account name angelcrack
```

We set "enyel29." as password, in order to autenticate the request, we will add the header:

```json
{
	Authorization: Basic YW5nZWxjcmFjazplbnllbDI5Lg==
}
```

Client requests which are authenticated via Basic Auth are given a cookie named 'JSESSIONIDSSO' in the response. This cookie can be provided in subsequent requests (instead of the Basic Auth 'Authorization' header) to re-use the authentication session.

The response will contain.

```json
{
	Cookie: JSESSIONIDSSO=2723FD93559E7FA7E17F0E7958D13; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
}
```
