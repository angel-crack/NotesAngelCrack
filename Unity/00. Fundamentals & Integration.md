# Cisco Voice Messaging Components

While there are many ways to send information between people, voice messaging is still sometimes the best way to relay information to another person. Most people have had an experience where a written message was read in a way that was not intended by the sender. A short verbal message can often convey the information and the emotion behind the information with less chance of an instant message or email giving the wrong impression. Voicemail systems such as Cisco Unity Connection allow a caller to be forwarded to a “mailbox,” which can record a message and play it back at a later time.

Cisco Unity Connection is a feature-rich voice messaging platform targeting medium- to large-enterprise customers, which can provide up to 20,000 voicemail boxes on a single server. Users can access their voicemails over the phone, through a web browser, or from their email inbox. Users can interact with Unity Connection over the phone by using the phone keypad or by using voice commands.

A single Unity Connection server can have up to 250 voice ports active at one time. Each voice port supports a single call into or out of the Unity Connection server. Voice ports can be used as follows:

- Record incoming messages.
- Play outgoing messages.
- Notify users of messages or send Message Waiting Indicator (MWI) notifications to a phone.
- Record outgoing greetings using the Telephony Record and Playback (TRAP) tool.

Cisco Unity Express is an entry-level voice messaging platform targeting small- to medium-enterprise customers. Cisco Unity Express can provide up to 500 voicemail boxes and up to 32 voice ports and runs on a network module installed on specific Cisco routers.

Cisco Unity Connection runs on a Linux-based operating system similar to Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Unity Connection supports only virtual machines for installation. Bare metal server installations are not supported. Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) templates are used when installing Unity Connection in VMware.

These templates set the resources assigned to each VMware instance, including:

- Number and speed of CPUs
- Amount of RAM
- Size of the virtual hard disk
The OVA template options can support different numbers of users:

- Up to 200 users (only available for the Cisco UCS E-Series router-integrated module)
- Up to 1000 users
- Up to 5000 users
- Up to 10,000 users
- Up to 20,000 users

# Integration

[+] Unity can be integrated to CUCM either with SIP or SCCP.

[+] Useful commands:
- show cuc cluster status
- utils dbreplication runtimestate
- utils service list

## Sip Integration

SIP:    Voice Mail Profile > Voice Mail Pilot > Route Pattern > SIP Trunk
SCCP:  Voice Mail Profile > Voice Mail Pilot >Hunt Pilot > Hunt List > Line Group > Voice Mail Port {1, 2, ... , n}


[+] Create SIP Trunk Sec Profile

[+] On SIP Profile, we should enable options ping.

[+] On Destination on SIP Trunk, we add the two ip addresses of unity, Pub and Sub.

[+] On Unity side, first we create a phone system: Telephony Integrations > Phone System:

![[Pasted image 20241019101300.png]]

On Phone System we managed the integrations, however it wont work until we have a port group associated to it.

[+] We add the port group:

![[Pasted image 20241019104109.png]]

Here we can choose the protocol for integration.

[+] Then, we create the ports, should be added to the Port group

![[Pasted image 20241019104701.png]]

[+] Phone System > Add Port group to Phone Sys > Add Ports to Port group

[+] The difference with SCCP 


![[Pasted image 20241029150440.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241029150700.png]]

From Phone perspective is quiet the same either it is SCCP or SIP:
