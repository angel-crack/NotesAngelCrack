# Exploring the Default System Call Handlers

![[Pasted image 20241031153233.png]]

There are three default system call handlers: the Opening Greeting, the Operator, and the Goodbye call handlers. The Opening Greeting is played when an unknown caller calls voicemail or when an unknown extension is forwarded to voicemail.

The Operator call handler is reached when a user presses 0 while a greeting is being played. By default, there is no extension assigned to this call handler. When a user presses 0 from the Opening Greeting call handler, the caller is sent to the Operator call handler. If an extension is defined in the Operator handler, Unity Connection attempts to transfer to that extension during open hours. If the extension is not defined, the Operator call handler will take a message and deliver that message to the Operator mailbox.

The Goodbye call handler is reached when a caller is forwarded to it from a user mailbox or from another call handler such as the Opening Greeting. The Goodbye call handler is normally the last point of contact with Unity Connection. If a person listens to the Opening call handlerâ€™s greeting and does not take any action, the person will be sent to the Goodbye call handler. The user may hear another greeting. If no action is taken, the caller is disconnected.

The default call handlers can be customized as needed. The outgoing greetings can be changed from the Edit Greeting page. Key press options available during the greeting can be changed on the Caller Input page.
