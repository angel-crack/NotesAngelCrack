In this topic, you will learn about the two ways in which Cisco Unity Connection can be installed, and how Unity Connection servers are networked.

Cisco Unity Connection can be installed as a single standalone server or as a two-node cluster. The first server installed is the Publisher. The second server installed is the Subscriber, which provides redundancy for the Publisher server.

Both servers are always active and can receive or play out messages. Each server provides up to 250 voice ports for a total of 500 voice ports for a two-node cluster. The maximum number of voicemail boxes remains at 20,000, regardless of whether one or two servers are used. Unlike Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Unity Connection can only support a single Subscriber for a maximum of two servers in a cluster.

HTTPS networking is the preferred method for combining multiple Unity Connection directories or to ensure that the connected servers can communicate with each other. Legacy digital networking is still supported but is no longer recommended.

A Unity Connection server or cluster of servers is referred to as a location. Locations use HTTPS to exchange directory information and SMTP to exchange voice messages with each other. Locations are linked in a hub-and-spoke topology. Hubs connect to one or more spokes as well as other hubs. Spokes only have a single connection to a hub. The maximum number of locations in an HTTPS network is 25.

The limits for the Cisco Unity Connection global directory for HTTPS networked locations are as follows:

- 100,000 users
- 150,000 contacts
- 100,000 system distribution lists
- 25,000 users per system distribution list

## Additional Features

Cisco Unity Connection provides many more features that just voicemail, including the following:

- **Voicemail to email services:** Voicemail messages converted to text and sent to your email inbox.
- **Auto-Attendant features:** Enable callers to your organization to hear a recorded message and select appropriate digits to route their call to the correct department.
- **Directory search:** Enable callers to navigate to an individual without knowing their extension, using the corporate directory.
- **Interview features:** Enable the playing of recorded questions, to be answered by a caller and the output sent in text form to your email.
