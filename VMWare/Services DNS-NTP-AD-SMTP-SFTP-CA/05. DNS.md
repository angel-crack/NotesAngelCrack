[+] Get the image for pihole/pihole:latest

docker pull pihole/pihole:latest

[+] Create the docker-compose:

``` yml
version: "3"

# More info at https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/ and https://docs.pi-hole.net/
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    # For DHCP it is recommended to remove these ports and instead add: network_mode: "host"
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "67:67/udp" # Only required if you are using Pi-hole as your DHCP server
      - "3001:80/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/Bogota'
      WEBPASSWORD: 'angelcrack'
    # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
    volumes:
      - './etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
      - './etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
    #   https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#note-on-capabilities
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN # Required if you are using Pi-hole as your DHCP server, else not needed
    restart: unless-stopped
```

[+] We need to stop "systemd-resolved" first

systemd-resolved is a service in the systemd system and service manager that provides network name resolution to local applications. It handles DNS queries, caches responses for faster access, and can provide DNS-based service discovery. It integrates with local network management and can work with multiple DNS servers, facilitating name resolution over various protocols.

```c
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
```

and disable the service

```c
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
```

[+] run:

``` c
docker compose up -d
```

[+] On http://localhost:3001/admin/login.php we will be able to manage the dns entries, the password will be "angelcrack"

[+] Another easy way to handle the routes is on the folder where the compose was executed, ./etc-pihole/custom.list we will find the routes, we can edit manually, save the document and restart the docker container

```c
sudo docker restart pihole
```
