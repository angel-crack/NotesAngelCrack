01. Create a file named "ca-csr.json", the content will be:

```json
{
  "CN": "AngelCrackCA",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "CO",
      "L": "Barranquilla",
      "O": "Foundever",
      "OU": "Certificate Unit",
      "ST": "Atlantico"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Create a file named "dockerfile" with the following content:

```yml
FROM golang:alpine

# Install necessary packages and set Go environment variables
RUN apk add --no-cache git build-base \
    && go install github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/cmd/cfssl@latest \
    && go install github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/cmd/cfssljson@latest

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /root

# Copy the CA CSR JSON file into the container
COPY ca-csr.json /root/ca-csr.json

# Create a startup script that generates the CA certificate when the container starts
RUN echo '#!/bin/sh' > /root/start.sh \
    && echo 'cfssl gencert -initca /root/ca-csr.json | cfssljson -bare /root/ca' >> /root/start.sh \
    && echo 'cfssl serve -address=0.0.0.0 -port=8888' >> /root/start.sh \
    && chmod +x /root/start.sh

# Verify that the script was created
RUN ls -la /

# Expose the cfssl service on port 8888
EXPOSE 8888

# Set the default command to run the startup script
CMD ["/root/start.sh"]
```

3. In the same folder where "ca-csr.json" and "dockerfile" are located, open the console and run:

```c
 docker build -t cfssl_image .
```

4. Create a file named "docker-compose.yml" with the following content:

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  cfssl:
    image: cfssl_image  # Name of your built image
    container_name: cfssl_container
    ports:
      - "8888:8888"  # Map port 8888 of the container to port 8888 on the host
    volumes:
      - ./output:/root/output  # Mount a local directory to a subfolder inside /root
    restart: unless-stopped
```

5. You will notice a new folder named "output" here we will put or get files from the container.
6. I have located a tomcat.csr inside the output folder
7. Now, let's move to the containter console, go into CLI and run:

```c
10:54:55 ❯ docker exec -it cfssl_container sh
~ #
```

8. Run the following command, and replace

``` powershell 
cfssl sign -ca ../ca.pem -ca-key ../ca-key.pem <csr to be signed> | cfssljson -bare <pem output file>
```

In my case will be:

``` c
11:16:48 ❯ docker exec -it cfssl_container sh
~ # cd output
~/output # cfssl sign -ca ../ca.pem -ca-key ../ca-key.pem tomcat.csr | cfssljson -bare tomcat-ca
2024/10/20 16:17:01 [INFO] signed certificate with serial number 83531293812658652004799527841780351234425357824
~/output # ls
tomcat-ca.csr  tomcat-ca.pem  tomcat.csr
~/output # cp ../ca.pem ca.pem
~/output # ls
ca.pem         tomcat-ca.csr  tomcat-ca.pem  tomcat.csr
~/output #
```

![[Pasted image 20241020112008.png]]

ca.pem will be the root certificate and tomcat-ca.pem will actually be the CA Signed cert (Identity).
