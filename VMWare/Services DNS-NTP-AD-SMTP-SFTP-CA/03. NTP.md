[+] Create an archive a named dockerfile (without extension), and paste the following content:

```
# Use a lightweight base image
FROM alpine:3.18

# Install chrony for NTP services
RUN apk add --no-cache chrony

# Copy the chrony configuration file into the container
COPY chrony.conf /etc/chrony/chrony.conf

# Expose NTP port
EXPOSE 123/udp

# Command to run chrony in the foreground
CMD ["chronyd", "-d", "-f", "/etc/chrony/chrony.conf"]
```

[+] In the same directory create chrony.conf, with the following content:

```
# Use the local system clock as a time source (stratum 10)
local stratum 2

# Allow all clients to access the NTP server
# (you can specify a specific subnet for better security, e.g., "192.168.0.0/24")
allow all

# Disable frequency tracking as we're using the local clock
driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift

# Specify the log directory for chrony
logdir /var/log/chrony

# Enable statistics tracking
log measurements statistics tracking

# Enable command access over the network (optional for remote monitoring)
cmdport 0

# Set the time correction threshold to avoid large jumps
makestep 1.0 3
```

[+] Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where dockerfile and chrony.conf are located and run:

``` c
docker build -t ntp-server .
```

[+] Check that the image is generated:

``` c
17:35:57 ‚ùØ docker image ls
REPOSITORY                          TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED           SIZE
ntp-server                          latest            577e0d5ee24a   1 minute ago      13.7MB
```

[+] Refer to [[02. Get Images for offline installation]] in order to export from PC with internet to an offline machine.

[+] Finally run the following command and the NTP server will get the time of the machine.

``` c
docker run -d --name ntp-server --net host --cap-add SYS_TIME ntp-server
```

[+] Or we can use the following docker-compose file:
```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  ntp-server:
    image: ntp-server
    container_name: ntp-server
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    cap_add:
      - SYS_TIME
```
